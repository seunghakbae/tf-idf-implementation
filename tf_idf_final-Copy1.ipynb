    "\n",
    "TF-IDF란 1세대 정보검색 기술로 page rank가 등장하기 전 사용되었던 기술이다. 아주 간단한 정보검색을 하는 방식은 각 document에 어떤 word가 있는 지 큰 테이블에 저장하는 방식이였다. 하지만, 이런 경우 table에서 모든 document를 하나씩 검색해서 찾아야 했고, 또 각 테이블마다 모든 단어의 존재 유무 및 개수를 저장해놓고 있어야 했다. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Inverted Table\n",
    "이렇게 되면, 단어의 수가 몇 만, 십만, 백만 개가 되고 document또한 비슷한 개수가 되면, 이 정보를 모두 가지고 있는 table을 만든다는 건 상상이 되지 않는다. 이럴 때 등장한 것이 INVERTED TABLE이다.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverted Table은 기준이 문서가 아니라 단어이다. 그래서, 각 단어를 기준으로 그 단어가 속한 document의 index를 linked list로 구현한 것이 inverted Table이다. \n",
    "\n",
    "## TF-IDF\n",
    "하지만, inverted table은 그 단어가 속한 document만 보여줄 뿐, 그 단어와 document가 얼마나 연관성이 있는 지 보여주진 못한다. 그래서, 이 연관성을 보여주기 위해서 나온 것이 tf-idf이다."

       "[[' (CNN)If you remember Miley twerking or Kanye\\'s mic-snatching, you\\'ll know music awards can get chaotic.Like on Tuesday, when singer Taylor Swift took a Twitter dig at hip-hop queen Nicki Minaj and the Internet erupted into a sprawling conversation about race and gender. And then Kim Kardashian got involved. Stay with us.\\'Black women are rarely rewarded\\'It started when Minaj took to her keyboard to vent after one of her biggest hits wasn\\'t nominated for video of the year for the MTV Video Music Awards.Mind you, this isn\\'t any old clip. \"Anaconda,\" an uproarious, raunchy twist on pop culture portrayals of curvy black women, received 19.6 million clicks in its first 24 hours, a music video record at the time. So the rapper had a reason to be upset when she was snubbed -- and she made her reasoning clear.\"If I was a different \\'kind\\' of artist, Anaconda would be nominated for best choreo and vid of the year as well,\" said Minaj.\"Black women influence pop culture so much but are rarely rewarded for it.\"She then tweeted: \"If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year.\"That\\'s when Taylor Swift -- who describes herself as a feminist -- jumped in, apparently taking the tweets personally.\"I\\'ve done nothing but love & support you. It\\'s unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot,\" she wrote.Unlike \"Anaconda,\" Swift\\'s video for \"Bad Blood\" was nominated for the top award. Featuring whisper-thin supermodels wielding guns, the pseudo-action movie dethroned Minaj\\'s video for most views in one day when it was released this year.It was a surprisingly barbed volley from a singer known for her meticulously crafted public image -- even Nicki Minaj seemed taken aback. \"Didn\\'t say a word about u,\" she replied.The rapper then retweeted a supporter who accused Taylor Swift of not being \"critical of racist media.\"Swift followed up with what seemed to be an attempt to smooth things over. \"You\\'re invited to any stage I\\'m ever on,\" she said.Miley Cyrus to host VMAsA double standard?Twitter wasn\\'t buying it: As \"Nicki\" and \"Taylor\" became worldwide trends, thousands of users came to Nicki Minaj\\'s defense.Many said the stars\\' exchange showed a double standard: Swift was widely praised as brave for speaking up about problems in the music industry last month -- now Minaj was getting lashed for doing the same. Nicki was making an important point, they argued: Not all women\\'s experiences are the same, but black women don\\'t often get taken as seriously.Users expressed disapproval with the contrasting way some media portrayed the respective artists: Taylor Swift -- beautiful, pure; Nicki Minaj -- hysterical, angry.Janet Mock, a writer and trans woman activist, suggested flipping the script, posting a picture of an angry Swift and a calm Minaj.It wasn\\'t long before at least one publication -- Entertainment Weekly -- apologized for their \"insensitive juxtaposition of photos.\"For many users, Swift and Minaj\\'s interaction reflected an all-too-familiar dynamic: A black woman makes a point, and a white woman tells her to simmer down or hijacks the conversation in the name of feminism.\"A black woman speaks up on racial problems within the music industry. A white woman makes it completely about herself,\" said user XLNB.Supporters of Taylor Swift began defending the singer with the hashtag #TeamTaylor. Some argued Beyonce\\'s nomination meant Nicki\\'s omission couldn\\'t have been about race.But at day\\'s end there were more than double the amount of tweets using the hashtag #TeamNicki, according to Topsy, a Twitter analytics site.Kim Kardashian, Bruno Mars join the frayThen, the conversation took a slightly absurd turn as Kim Kardashian waded into the story -- unwittingly, she claims.As the Nicki and Taylor saga continued to ride high in Twitter\\'s trends, the reality show star tweeted a photo of herself with the caption, \"Imma let you finish but...\"For those of you who missed the reference: Kanye West -- Kim Kardashian\\'s husband -- uttered that phrase when he grabbed the microphone from Taylor Swift at the MTV Music Video Awards in 2009. So it sounded like Kim was telling Taylor to back off. Something she frantically denied once users started pointing out the connection.\"Wait wait I\\'m in Paris it\\'s the middle of the night & I\\'m posting my Vogue Spain pics not having a clue what\\'s going on in the music world,\" she wrote.If that weren\\'t enough drama for an evening, rapper Meek Mill, Nicki Minaj\\'s boyfriend, decided before midnight that it would be a perfect time to launch an attack on superstar hip-hop artist Drake.But in the end, it was mild-mannered Bruno Mars, a video of the year nominee, who may have won the night, with a joking provocation of fellow nominee Ed Sheeran.\"Yo I want in on this twitter Beef!! VMAs is the new WWF!! @edsheeran F*** You!\" he said.And that is how the Internet works.'],\n",
       " [' (CNN)Kanye West is on an apology spree.In a series of tweets, West  reached out to singers Beck and Bruno Mars to express remorse over his well-documented disses. \"I would like to publicly apologize to Beck. I\\'m sorry Beck,\" West tweeted Thursday night. Beyonce backerWest turned heads -- and not in a good way -- when he briefly  went on stage after Beck won a Grammy for Album of the Year. In an interview after the show this month, West asked  Beck \"to respect artistry\" and give the award to Beyonce.Though West did not grab Beck\\'s microphone like he\\'s done in the past, his brief stunt was similar to a 2009 incident when he stormed the stage during the VMAs and declared Beyonce should have won an award instead of Taylor Swift. West and Swift appeared to put it behind them, hugging it out at this month\\'s Grammys. Bruno propsBruno Mars got more than an apology Thursday. \"I used to hate on him but I really respect what he does as an artist,\" West tweeted.  West then asked him to sing a hook on a song that he co-produced.There was no immediate response from Bruno Mars or Beck. '],\n",

A clanking sound could be heard in the background as she sang, her microphone cut out briefly and Adele\\'s voice didn\\'t have its usual punch. The singer looked distracted, flashing irritated looks as she powered through the song, backed only by a piano and bathed in a lone spotlight.Fans, who anticipated another killer performance, were confused.

According to Variety, he said that as the piano was being lifted onto the stage, a microphone in the piano dropped, which caused the audio glitches heard during the broadcast. Technicians tried to correct it by going to a backup system, which caused the feed to be lost for a second, he said.\"To Adele\\'s credit, she killed it, she did a fantastic job, the pro that she is,\" Portnow said. \"That was all an issue on our behalf.

Since its release in April 2016, the album has been hailed by women of color for reflecting their experience.\"The video album writes black women back into national, regional and diasporic histories by making them the progenitors and rightful inheritors of the Southern gothic tradition,\" Zandria F. Robinson wrote for Rolling Stone. \"Beyond \\'strong\\' and \\'magic,\\' \\'Lemonade\\' asserts that black women are alchemists and metaphysicians who are at once of the past, present and future, changing and healing the physical, chemical and spiritual world around them.\"  Adele acknowledged that power in her acceptance speech.\"You are our light,\" Adele said from the stage, as Beyoncé cried in the audience. \"And the way you make me and my friends feel -- the way you make my black friends feel -- is empowering and you make them stand up for themselves.\"Adele\\'s \\'black friends\\' Grammy comment stirs debateBeyoncé joins a long list of acclaimed black artists whose album of the year losses have been decried -- and it\\'s not the first time for Bey.Rapper Kanye West crashed the Grammy stage in protest in 2015 when Beck\\'s \"Morning Phase\" eclipsed Beyoncé\\'s self-titled album for the award. There was an outcry in 2014 when rapper Kendrick Lamar\\'s \"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City\" lost to Daft Punk\\'s \"Random Access Memories.\" Even the late Prince was passed over with his two album of the year nominations, including his very popular and critically acclaimed \"Purple Rain\" in 1985 (though he lost to another black artist, Lionel Richie).The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, whose members vote on the Grammy Awards, does not release a breakdown of their voting body based on race, gender or age. But the Academy has long insisted that the Grammys voting body is diverse and reflective of the music industry\\'s artists.Recording Academy president Neil Portnow told Variety last year that the awards show strives \"to be a microcosm of the music that\\'s made in any given year.\"\"We\\'re proud to be able to be representative that way,\" he said. \"It\\'s the great melting pot, without a doubt.\"But Powell said that\\'s not reflected when the trophies are handed out.\"American music would not exist without the massive influence of black people and black music, but that is not evidenced by who gets the big awards year to year, with few exceptions,\" he said. Powell added that he had no issue with Adele winning song and record of the year, but still disagreed with her winning album of the year.\"The Grammys become more inclusive by not consistently awarding folks like Beyoncé \\'urban\\' trophies, while giving the top prizes to the white artists,\" he said. Jem Aswad, a senior editor for Billboard, said that while there can be no denying that issues of race crop up in the music industry just like they do anyplace else, there are still counter arguments that can be made as to why Adele won.The Grammys has been known to play it safe, he said, and Beyonce\\'s album was incredibly provocative. Also, Adele\\'s album had three hit singles while Beyonce\\'s did not. Aswad said there were smaller factors like \"Lemonade\" only being available to stream on Tidal which, while they may not have affected Grammy voting, weighed on the album\\'s exposure. \"There are all these complicated factors that prevent it from being a very straight narrative,\" he said. \"Not for nothing, black women have won album of the year -- which is the gold standard at the Grammys -- only three times in its history. Those three artists were Natalie Cole with the \\'Unforgettable\\' album, which is one of the safest albums that you could imagine, Whitney Houston with the \\'Bodyguard\\' soundtrack, which had a giant movie behind it, as well as a huge radio hit and the marketing juggernaut Clive Davis, and Lauryn Hill\\'s album which was edgier, but still went down fairly easy for audiences.\" Harvey Mason Jr., a six-time Grammy Award-winning songwriter, told CNN last year that the Recording Academy was working on being more in step with what appeals to fans.Do the Grammys also have a race problem?Ultimately, he said, they are the ones who have the final say as to what is good music.\"Most people don\\'t care who sings what,\" Mason said. \"There is no \\'black music\\' or \\'white music.\\' Make good art and people will listen to it.\"'],\n",

But rather than limit his activism to groaning, the 23-year-old public school product instead announced Monday he was giving $1 million to Chicago schools and his charity, SocialWorks, would give $10,000 for every additional $100,000 raised. Of course, the rapper is no stranger to philanthropy. He\\'s done his part to combat gun violence in his hometown and raised money to put coats on kids\\' backs and to bring technology upgrades to schools, among other endeavors. Too often, it seems, rappers make headlines for their bad behavior. So let\\'s have a look at 10 hip-hop stars who have used their influence to make the world a little nicer. 2 ChainzGroups supported: Hip-Hop Summit Action Network, Voto Latino, TRU FoundationNo lie, Atlanta\\'s Titi Boi is a serious philanthropist. Not only did he reportedly raise $2 million in 2015 through sales of his \"Dabbin\\' Santa\" ugly Christmas sweaters, but he announced that he was looking for needy families to spend it on. Some of that money went to buying furniture and paying a year\\'s worth of rent for an unemployed single mother and disabled veteran from his hometown of College Park, Georgia. He also bought a minivan for a family who lost their home in a fire and provided a five-bedroom home for a year to a family of 11.2 Chainz has attributed his charitable nature to never forgetting the hardships he endured as a kid: \"I remember when we didn\\'t have hot water and I didn\\'t want my friends to know, so I told them it was something wrong with that bathroom and they couldn\\'t use my mommas, i remember using the oven to heat the house, I would stand in the kitchen for hours to stay warm.\"NasGroups supported: UNICEF, Save the Music Foundation, Saving Our Daughters Queensbridge\\'s finest was watching the news in 2013 when a report aired about a widower and father of eight who had just lost his home in a fire. Nas launched a Tilt campaign that raised almost $65,000 for Stanley Young\\'s housing. \"The happy ending we created for the Youngs can be the beginning of something bigger for our communities, and for single parents down on their luck all across the country,\" Nas wrote of the campaign. During Art Basel in 2011, the \"Made You Look\" rhymesmith tried his hand at painting during his set at Miami\\'s Ricochet Bar & Lounge. He then sold his first-ever masterpiece at an impromptu auction for $14,000, which he donated to a children\\'s cancer charity. Lil WayneGroups supported: STOKED, The Motivational Edge, Tha Carter FundLil Wayne has clothed kids in Haiti, opened a skate park in New Orleans\\' Lower Ninth Ward, bought a wheelchair for a disabled fan\\'s mother and channeled Bob Dylan  for \"We Are the World 25 For Haiti.\" He also joins his Cash Money Records brethren in handing out turkeys around his native New Orleans during the holidays. Weezy\\'s hometown is clearly dear to him. When Harrell Park, where the 34-year-old multiplatinum rapper played as a kid, fell victim to Hurricane Katrina -- and then became a parking lot for FEMA trailers -- Lil Wayne kicked in $200,000 to help rebuild the park. Today, the park boasts basketball courts, lit fields, an outdoor pool and track. The Game Groups supported: World Vision, Food Bank of Eastern Michigan, The Robin Hood Project In what might have been a little charitable ... gamesmanship, Los Angeles\\' The Game last year mocked singer Madonna\\'s and comedian Jimmy Fallon\\'s $10,000 donations to help with the Flint, Michigan, water crisis. He then showed \"How We Do\" by vowing via Instagram to donate $1 million worth of water and posted a wire receipt showing he had already handed over half that amount. The 37-year-old\\'s The Robin Hood Project has been helping people ever since The Game encountered a Nigerian man in Australia sharing a one-bedroom apartment with 20 people. He wanted to help the gentleman, but had only 20 Australian dollars on him at the time. \"So, I gave him the 20 and for the next week I couldn\\'t sleep,\" he said. \"I just wanted to help, you know? I wanted to do more. So, I came up with the idea of The Robin Hood Project.\"EminemGroups supported: Eight Mile Boulevard Association, Marshall Mathers FoundationDespite the occasional report that he has lent his support to the Elton John AIDS Foundation or contributed to the Philippines\\' typhoon disaster relief efforts, Slim Shady and his Marshall Mathers Foundation keep a fairly low profile.He \"doesn\\'t personally believe in publicizing philanthropy,\" the rapper\\'s foundation\\'s secretary once explained. Every once in a while, though, a story slips out. Such was the case in 2013 when it was revealed that the self-professed \"Rap God\" had donated $200,000 to Wolverine Human Services, which helps at-risk youth in Michigan. CEO Judith Wollack was delighted to finally be able to speak about the hometown hero\\'s generosity, after keeping it a secret for two years. She explained the money had been spent on buying children gifts over a span of two years. Queen LatifahGroups supported: Keep a Child Alive, Girl Up, The Trevor Project\"The Princess of the Posse\" has had a hand in many a hit song and movie, but she\\'s also produced her fair share of smiles through her philanthropy. When a Camden, New Jersey, drill team had to vacate its dilapidated practice facility for repairs in July 2014, the rapper/actress stepped up with $10,000 for the Camden Sophisticated Sisters. During a 2006 telethon for hurricane relief, she kicked in $100,000 to help victims of Katrina.In addition to contributing to LGBT, senior citizen, civil rights and anti-bullying efforts, Latifah\\'s helped a variety of other groups, including veterans. In June 2015, she gifted the version of national anthem that she performed a few months earlier at the NBA All-Star Game to Fisher House, which provides \"comfort homes\" to the families of hospitalized veterans. The organization sold the single for download and streaming and used the proceeds to help military families.J. ColeGroups supported: The Dreamville FoundationThe \"Born Sinner\" certainly atones with generosity. Though he moved to New York after high school, J. Cole never forgets his hometown of Fayetteville, North Carolina.Prior to the 2013 school year, he kicked off a tradition of donating school supplies -- including backpacks, notebooks and pens -- and he announced that his old Fayetteville home, made famous on the cover of his album, \"Forest Hills Drive,\" would serve as rent-free transitional housing for single mothers in the Cackalack.The 32-year-old\\'s annual Dreamville Weekend focuses on uplifting the Fayetteville community with an appreciate dinner, a career panel of African-American professionals and events honoring community leaders. It\\'s all part of the effort to help urban youth \"have a dream, believe in their dream and achieve their dream.\"LudacrisGroups supported: Artists for Peace and Justice, Stand Up to Cancer, Ludacris FoundationThe \"Get Back\" rapper gives back, that\\'s for sure. When flooding hit Atlanta in 2009, he donated to recovery efforts and handed out more than 500 coats to students who had found their homes and school underwater. When he learned Venetian Hills Elementary School had gone years without a playground, he helped build one. After Typhoon Haiyan, he gave generously to the United Nations agency scurrying to feed the battered Philippines. \"We were put on this Earth to help others. All you blessed people go bless someone else,\" the three-time Grammy winner has said. Through his eponymous charity and other outlets, Luda has followed up on those words, taking on a litany of causes, including cancer, the environment, at-risk youth, AIDS, human trafficking, poverty and literacy. 50 CentGroups supported: Shriners Hospitals for Children, New York Restoration ProjectNot many rappers have been called a \"humanitarian genius\" in the UN Dispatch. But Fitty earned the moniker in 2012 after announcing he would donate a billion meals to the UN World Food Program. At 10 cents a meal, that meant $100 million, which the rapper said would come from sales of his Street King energy drinks. He even visited Kenya and Somalia to better understand the hunger problems facing those countries. Back home, the Queens native\\'s G-Unity Foundation has worked to lift up impoverished Americans, while the rapper has teamed up with Feeding America to deliver food to hungry children.Last year, he fell out of many fans\\' good graces when he filmed himself teasing an autistic janitor he thought was stoned. He issued an apology, as well as a $100,000 check to Autism Speaks. DiddyGroups supported: Jackie Robinson Foundation, Tony Hawk Foundation, Prince\\'s TrustOh, where to begin with Sean Combs?

He also won two tournaments in Japan to further boost his growing reputation.Matsuyama is also bidding to become the first Japanese major winner, and only second Asian male victor after South Korea\\'s YE Yang pipped Woods to the 2009 US PGA. Matsuyama has finished in the top seven in the Masters for the past two years and came tied fourth for his best major finish at last year\\'s US PGA.

Woods may never reach his previous heights again; aged 40, he\\'s cast doubt on his lifelong quest to break Jack Nicklaus\\' record of 18 major titles.But, given the Golden Bear won his 16th, 17th and 18th majors after his 40th birthday, a revitalized Tiger certainly has plenty to play for. As he prepares to put troubled times behind him, CNN reporters recall the times they met one of history\\'s most fascinating sportsmen.1997, Atlantic City - Gary TuchmanWoods\\' first major triumph came at Augusta in 1997 when he became the youngest Masters champion in history and its first non-white winner. The next day, he was in New Jersey, and so was CNN correspondent Gary Tuchman ...\"I have long been a sports fan and followed Woods\\' amateur career. When CNN asked me if I would like to meet Tiger and interview him, I jumped at the opportunity. I believed he would likely become the best golfer to ever play the game.\"People were very excited to meet him. There was a buzz on the boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey where this all took place. People knew he was a young man who was likely to make history.\"Woods was polite, thoughtful, and considerate. I remember thinking to myself that I hoped he would always stay that way because I was so certain he would be immensely successful and so many people who become rich and famous don\\'t keep the values they had when it all began. \"Tiger clearly knew what he was capable of at a young age. And I also had little doubt about his capabilities. It is amazing now to look back and know that what he, I, and so many others thought would happen did indeed happen. \"The difference of course is that he was relatively innocent and naive back then. Now, he has the physical and emotional scars that one often gets as the years go by.\"With the benefit of hindsight, I would ask him if he was concerned about the pressures of being on the PGA Tour and his personal life off the tour. I would ask him if he felt he had the support to deal with all of that. \"And then I wish I said to him that I hope he has a happy and healthy career. I try to be polite when I interview people and I don\\'t think I got the chance to say that to him as he began his path to fame and fortune.\"Related: Story behind golfer\\'s $17M smile2008, Dubai - Don RiddellFast forward 11 years and Woods was living up to the hype. Aged 32, he was ranked as the world\\'s No. 1 golfer having won a further 12 majors -- including four in a row between June 2000 and April 2001. But away from the course, it had been a turbulent couple of years. His father Earl passed away in 2006, the sadness of which was somewhat offset by the birth of Woods\\' first daughter Sam in June 2007. Both events were discussed when Woods sat down with CNN World Sport\\'s Don Riddell in 2008 ...\"I interviewed Tiger five or six times over a three-year period and I felt like we got to know each other pretty well during that time ... but it seems like a lifetime ago now. \"So much has changed, he\\'s no longer the golfer and athlete who dominated the world and obviously his personal life is totally different.\"For three consecutive years we met in Dubai at the Dubai Desert Classic, always on Wednesday lunchtime after his pro-am round and always in the same elevated location above the lush practice green.\"We used to talk a lot -- both on camera and off -- about our families and how lucky we were. I think he was genuinely excited to be a Dad and absolutely devastated when his father passed away.\"I\\'ll always remember his reaction when I told him I had twin boys in 2006 \\'Twins?,\\' he exclaimed, \\'Holy s**t!\\' \"I guess my reaction was similar when he hit the fire hydrant in 2009 and everything fell apart; turns out I\\'d been getting an overly varnished account of his marital bliss.  \"He once told me that he didn\\'t want to be remembered for his achievements as a golfer, more for his \\'actions as a human being.\\'\"Hopefully I\\'ll get to see him again one day. If so, I\\'d ask what has been the single biggest regret of his life. Whether it\\'s personal or professional, I think that would be very revealing.\" Related: The quest for a green jacket starts with ... a white boiler suit2012, China - Shane O\\'DonoghueBy 2012, Woods\\' life had unraveled in spectacular fashion. A minor car crash in November 2009 began a chain of events which led to the revealing of multiple infidelities and, ultimately, the break-up of Woods\\' marriage to Elin Nordegren. His golf game had suffered too. He won the U.S. Open in 2008 but a severe loss of form and fitness meant he\\'d failed to win a major in over three years by the time he sat down with CNN Living Golf\\'s Shane O\\'Donoghue in November 2012. And he wasn\\'t alone. A new generation of golfers, who\\'d grown up idolizing Woods, were now overtaking their hero at the top of the game. Chief among them was Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy ...\"It was a whirlwind trip to China for 36 hours. A long way to go, but it was an opportunity to host the first ever sit-down interview with Tiger and Rory McIlroy. Rory had yet to be announced as a Nike player, but the rumors had begun of a multimillion dollar deal. I remember noting that he wore Nike trainers to the interview. \"That was revealing, but we couldn\\'t really speak about it, as he was still under contract to his other clothing sponsors. Rory and Tiger had both decided not to compete in the WGC event later that week in Shanghai, which caused a bit of a fuss. \"They were here in Zhengzhou for a big money match and we were the only television interview that they were doing, so it was a real exclusive. I\\'d interviewed him once in Dubai for CNN about 18 months previously. \"I\\'d also interviewed him after various rounds at the Masters, in my previous role for the BBC. \"Tiger was very friendly. He arrived early for the interview and came straight over to me. We spoke about his other sporting passion, NFL. \"He is a great friend of the Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, and they had been beaten a few hours before and he was still smarting at the loss, so we spoke about that and how Romo is also a good golfer. \"Tiger was very relaxed and very good humored. We were off to a good start and then Rory turned up, also in good form. The two had a very natural friendship and it certainly wasn\\'t forced. They were laughing and joking. It was clear that they were genuinely friendly. \"It was a good atmosphere. However, it was very noticeable how Tiger changed the minute the red light went on and we began recording the interview. It wasn\\'t bad or anything, just a very noticeable change in his demeanor as soon as we started. He doesn\\'t really like interviews. \"He was lighthearted again once we finished and wished me a safe trip home. I hope to interview Tiger many more times in the future!

       " [' (CNN)Dustin Johnson solidified his status at the top of golf\\'s world rankings, holding off a late challenge at the WGC-Mexico Championship to clinch a second successive PGA Tour victory. The American, 32, closed with a round of 68 to finish 14-under par, one shot clear of England\\'s Tommy Fleetwood.Johnson only secured top spot from Jason Day two weeks ago, strolling to a five-shot victory at California\\'s Genesis Open. Now he has a fourth WGC title -- more than anyone other than Tiger Woods (18) -- and becomes just the fifth player in history to win his first tournament as world No. 1.The only other players to do so are Ian Woosnam, David Duval, Vijay Singh and Adam Scott. \"It means a lot because it\\'s a tough spot to be in,\" said Johnson, alluding to the \"pressure\" of his new berth. \"I played just well enough I guess because I won by one.\"The game\\'s perennial nearly man is making up for lost time. Without a major win until last year\\'s US Open, Johnson could easily have faltered here after lashing his first drive of the tournament out-of-bounds.Instead, final-round birdies at the eighth and ninth holes gave him a four-shot lead that would be reduced but not relinquished.

       " [' (CNN)When Tiger Woods faced down the famous \"Postage Stamp\" eighth hole on the final day of the 1997 Open Championship at Royal Troon, he did so with high hopes of challenging for the second major of his then fledgling career.The 21-year-old recent Masters champion, who had carded a course record-equaling seven-under-par 64 a day earlier, was looking to hunt down leaders Jesper Parnevik and Justin Leonard.Yet those ambitions soon lay in tatters as the American succumbed to one of links golf\\'s most infamous par-three tests, recording a three-over-par six to drop back.Although the shortest hole on the Open circuit at just 123 yards, many of the game\\'s best have been unable to cope with the deep bunkers and unforgiving winds that often swirl around the narrow, tempting putting surface of the Postage Stamp.\"There is no doubt, it is our signature hole,\" says Royal Troon captain Martin Cheyne. \"People will sit in the bar here, sit in the clubhouse, and talk about how they played (it).\"Other greats to stall here include Walter Hagen, who carded a final-round double bogey to finish one shot behind Arthur Havers in 1923. And as Greg Norman advanced to a playoff with eventual winner Mark Calcavecchia in the 1989 Open, the only place he dropped a shot on the final day was, of course, the eighth.Yet there are a lucky few who can say they have licked the Postage Stamp. Gene Sarazen recorded an ace here at the 1973 championship, 50 years after he first graced the Open. Ernie Els also notched a hole-in-one here in 2004 -- although he ultimately fell just short that year, losing in a playoff to Todd Hamilton. \\'A test of links golf\\'At a meeting of golf writers earlier this year, Open organizer the R&A revealed it has the option of reducing the length of the Postage Stamp to as little as 99 yards when the championship returns to Royal Troon this week.A wire camera will also swoop between tee and hole enabling television viewers to see action unfold on the Postage Stamp like never before.But the 145th version of the world\\'s oldest golf tournament will be about more than just the drama provided by a solitary par three on a course that is 7,175 yards long.According to Royal Troon head professional Kieron Stevenson, the wider course remains a \"proper test of links golf.\" While agreeing the eighth is a challenge and an icon, Stevenson highlights the 490-yard, par-four 11th, The Railway, as another that can surprise players. And with the back nine generally played into the prevailing winds, he adds that players will be looking to hold onto their score as they head towards the clubhouse.\"I think certainly around Troon you\\'re required to hit it straight off the tee. The fairway bunkers are so severe and have such a big penalty that straightness off the tee is a real key,\" Stevenson continues.Relatively small, subtle greens also mean that approach shots will be important, he adds, while an ability to read the undulating putting surfaces could go a long way to deciding an eventual victor.\"You have to be a very good reader of the greens and ... the wind blowing in the background ... makes it doubly difficult,\" Stevenson says.Betting on the weatherWith the last six winners of the British Open at Royal Troon having come from the U.S., betting men may do well to consider the challenge of the leading American players such as Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson.However, prominent Europeans players such as Rory McIlroy and Henrik Stenson may have something to say about that, not to mention world No 1., Australian Jason Day.For Cheyne, however, staging a successful tournament is the primary factor dominating preparations.\"First and foremost, we want a good competition,\" Cheyne says. \"We need excitement. We need ... a number of people competing at the end. We need good weather.\"This course does need some wind to make it the course it is,\" Cheyne continues. \"And, ideally, getting some wind on moving day, on the Saturday, would be the best.\" Quite whether those looking down the Postage Stamp at the business end of the championship will agree is another matter.'],\n",
       " [' (CNN)Golf is a game of skill, sportsmanship, and numbers. From counting strokes that are over or under par to calculating the proximity of the shot\\'s distance to each hole, numbers play a vital role in understanding the sport.  While some fans are satisfied with the surface of golf entertainment, others desire to dig deeper into the numbers -- using them to predict, quantify, and speak for a majority of the action.  Golf\\'s chief number cruncher is Mark Broadie. A professor of business and vice dean at Columbia Business School, Broadie\\'s expertise is rooted in years of working in finance assessment and risk management. As an avid golfer he uses the same analytic tools from his line of work to try to understand and predict player performance. \"It turns out that this old expression in golf, \\'drive for show putt for dough\\' is wrong,\" says Broadie.Read: U.S. Open -- Oakmont poses \"hardest\" testLength is importantTraditionally, fairly simple statistics have been used to gauge performance such as putts per green and putts per round, but Broadie\\'s style considers the proximity and possible outcome of every shot. He calls it the Strokes Gained method and argues that an aggressive long-game approach to the hole is more important than the putting game.   \"Sinking a one-footer does not require great skill. Almost everybody can do it all the time,\" Broadie said. \"Sinking an eight-footer is a better performance. And sinking a 30-footer is an even better performance. \"So instead of just counting, you want to measure performance relative to the difficulty of the shot. And for a putt, sinking a longer putt is harder than sinking a shorter putt. And all Strokes Gained does is recognize and quantify that fact.\" Moneyball for golfThe PGA Tour incorporated Broadie\\'s Strokes Gained: putting analysis into its statistics package in 2011, and three years later added Strokes Gained: tee-to-green. On June 1, the tour went further and now breaks this down into strokes gained off the tee, strokes gained with approach shots and strokes gained around the green. The Tour\\'s data is provided by ShotLink, which compiles detailed information on every shot played on the circuit. The outcome of each shot is measured against the historical benchmark.A similar story of pioneering data analysis occurred in baseball in 2002 when the Oakland Athletics\\' general manager Billy Beane and his head assistant Paul DePodesta relied on sabermetrics over traditional scouting to select a cost and performance effective squad. The experience was captured by Michael Lewis in a bestselling book titled \"Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game\", and later turned into the feature film \"Moneyball\". One could argue that Broadie\\'s strategy introduces the Moneyball mindset into golf and innovates the future of evaluating and predicting player performance.     The data is already changing the way players and coaches prepare. Putting stats that may not stand out under the scope of putts per round sometimes show improved results through the lens of putting distance.   \"It turns out that the best players win and they gain the most strokes because of their approach shots, not because of their putting ability,\" Broadie said.  Working as a self-described \"Golf Doctor,\" Broadie has advised the coaches of Tiger Woods, Jordan Spieth, Jason Day and a number of others. \"They want to see, \\'has this swing change improved my ball striking in a given area? Has this change in my putting stroke, or the club that I\\'m using helped or hurt?\\'\" He explained, \"It\\'s more trying to figure out a player\\'s strengths and weaknesses, and then it\\'s up to the coach and the player to figure out how to turn those weaknesses into strengths.\" Ryder Cup Broadie\\'s research is currently in the spotlight with the Ryder Cup quickly approaching. Though he is not working directly with either team, his Strokes Gained method will help the coaches determine which pairings are best for each team and will be especially useful for U.S. captain Davis Love III and his European counterpart Darren Clarke in selecting their Captain\\'s Picks.  This year\\'s tournament is unlike any other due to there being more data to use for analysis. In the past strategies have been formed on the traditional statistics rather than calculating all possible percentages.  \"There are a lot of different places including course strategy -- how aggressive or conservative to play a hole -- where an analytical approach can sometimes give you a little bit of an edge that might in the end make a difference. Or the difference.\"  While Broadie\\'s work is specific and innovating, he is not alone in his commitment to better the game. Former leading amateur Bryson DeChambeau recently signed as a professional and said golf is 10 years behind other sports in its use of data. Also referred to as the \"Golf Scientist,\" DeChambeau\\'s research and experiments with designing his own single-length sets has worked for him personally, but has yet to be picked up by major commercial markets.  \"Bryson DeChambeau and I have spoken and we certainly have similar opinions about the role of analytics and physics in golf,\" said Broadie. Strokes Gained could be the key to helping advance the game at a professional and amateur level.  WATCH: \\'The Numbers Game\\' '],\n",

       " [' (CNN)This is golf with a difference. Forget immaculate clubhouses, perfectly manicured greens and pristine bunkers.Instead, think car boots, plastic buckets, plant pots and brass gorillas.The third edition of the European Urban Golf Cup (EUGC) took place in May this year and it saw a new breed of golfers pitch and putt their way across a bizarre set of obstacles throughout east London.\"50% of players play urban golf for fun and the other part play for competition,\" EUGC co-founder David Lardier told CNN at Stratford\\'s Olympic Park, which served as an impressive backdrop for the 120 participants vying for the much-coveted winner\\'s trophy.\"It\\'s normal that there is a competitive spirit because it\\'s a cup and there is a winner, but firstly it\\'s very convivial and there is a friendly spirit.\"While some golfers are known for their own individual fashion senses -- Ian Poulter and his loud clothing, for example -- Lardier wanted to give his tournament its own unique touch.Each player was given a t-shirt that bore the words \"God save the Queen,\" a reference to the British National Anthem.Urban golf is very much a labor of love for the 30-year-old Lardier, who is the CEO of DL Live -- an event and digital communication agency launched in January. Due to his work commitments, he plays urban golf two or three times a week but often uses evenings and weekends to prepare for tournaments like the EUGC.With the concept still catching on, Lardier has had to face his own obstacles in organizing the event.And when it comes to health and safety, Lardier has discovered you can never be too careful. As we\\'re talking, a volunteer comes running through the door to tell him that the tournament is at risk of being canceled due to a lack of monitors on the course. That\\'s nothing compared to the difficulties he has faced in France, where the police have been called several times. After a brief discussions, the gendarmes always let them continue -- with the lure of such a strange sport proving too much to resist for some officers, who sometimes have even joined them for a few holes.\"We had the permission from the Olympic Park, so it\\'s just a question of organization and it\\'s not a problem with the public,\" said Lardier.\"In Cologne last year we had permission from the local area and there weren\\'t any problems. But in Paris, it\\'s different because, just in Paris, we play without authorization but the authorities still let us play.\"If people call the police they come, but we have never had any problems with the authorities. Sometimes they ask about it and want to try the sport for themselves.\"Sometime known as street golf, urban golf was born in the late 1990s when a group of Germans took to the streets of Berlin armed with real balls and clubs and began creating makeshift holes for themselves around the city.In essence the sport is about bringing golf to your neighborhood.\"They were playing in the street and it wasn\\'t a real challenge like today; it was not a sport, it was just a fun game with friends,\" Lardier explained. \"In France in 2003, another group of friends who lived in Paris decided to play golf in the park, in the street and city because they wouldn\\'t like to go outside of the city into the suburbs to play real golf.\"Those early days of the sport were hazardous for passers by, not least because Lardier admitted that several members of the public had been hit by stray balls.\"A few years after people started playing street golf, U.S. brand almostGOLF launched a little ball especially to play in the street,\" said Lardier. \"You can\\'t break anything, you can\\'t injure any people with it so street golf was born in Germany, France and later England and other countries.\"Urban golf has come a long way since its birth, thanks in no small part to Lardier and his EUGC co-founder Sascha Bien. The event has taken place each year since its inception in 2013  -- in various European cities -- and the number of participants have surged.Fifty-four players from France and Germany took to the streets of Paris to contest the first cup, their number growing to 96 the following year in Cologne, Germany. This year in Stratford, 120 on the starting list.A host of nations are now also represented, including the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and Hungary, though absentees include Spain and Italy.\"After the first competition we decided to open the event to other countries because it was logical for us to have a lot of European countries, as we wanted to develop urban golf and the value of urban golf. \"Not just the practice of the sport itself, but the values, philosophy and the spirit. And for us it was important to organize a big event like the EUGC.\" Lardier is a big believer that golf can create camaraderie between countries and should be used to bring people together. These values are a factor when it comes to deciding who will host the next tournament.

       " [' (CNN)The US carried out \"targeted drone strikes\" in Yemen on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, killing a handful of al Qaeda militants, according to a US official and the Pentagon.The strikes were aimed at al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and were the first such strikes to take place under President Donald Trump.The strikes, which were later confirmed by the Pentagon, did not require Trump to sign off on them. Under then-President Barack Obama, the authority to order such strikes in Yemen was devolved to the four-star commander of US Central Command, Gen. Joseph Votel.The strikes killed five al Qaeda operatives and took place in the town of al Bayda, according to Pentagon spokesman US Navy Capt. Jeff Davis.\"(Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) remains a significant threat to the region and the United States,\" Davis said.Yemen is currently beset by a civil war between Houthi rebels, a minority Shia group from the north of the country, and the internationally recognized government, led by President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Saudi Arabia is leading a military intervention against the Houthis  in support of the government.\"(Al Qaeda) is using the unrest in Yemen to provide a haven from which to plan future attacks against the US and its interests,\" Davis added, saying, \"We remain committed to defeating (al Qaeda in Yemen) and denying it a safe haven.\"'],\n",
       " [' (CNN)Donald Trump is turning the world upside down.Some US enemies like Russia are becoming his friends, and longtime US allies like Germany are wondering whether America will be there for them any more.Geopolitical groups and alliances like the EU and NATO that have underpinned US global leadership for generations are reeling from Trump\\'s disparaging comments.Amid the tumult, world leaders are hurriedly repositioning themselves to deal with the new world disorder that the incoming American president seems to herald.China, for example, despite its Communist political system is moving into a vacuum left by Trump\\'s hostility to free trade deals to position itself as the champion of unfettered and open commerce.Russian President Vladimir Putin is emerging as Trump\\'s most vocal defender, despite allegations of Moscow having cyber hacked in the US election.In the Arab world, US allies are mustering to head off the firestorm they fear if Trump honors his campaign vow to move the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.And in the Western Hemisphere, another traditional American friend, Mexico, is insisting it won\\'t pay for the wall Trump has pledged to build on the Southern border. Even Canada is bracing for tense ties with its neighbor since the President-elect has promised to renegotiate NAFTA.It all means that the 45th president will take office with foreign allies and adversaries alike puzzled -- and, in some cases, alarmed -- that the certainties which have underpinned US foreign policy for generations no longer seem to apply.America, always looked to for stability, continuity and as a guarantor of the liberal world order, now could become under Trump one of the most disruptive global forces -- at least if he follows through on his threats.His hyperactive transition that has rattled the rest of the world will ensure he faces a string of simmering foreign policy questions as soon as he takes office.ChinaUS presidents have for decades based policy toward China on the need to avoid a clash between the world\\'s last real superpower and the dominant power in Asia. Trump, however, seems to be doing exactly the opposite.He\\'s spent his transition tweaking Beijing over the status of Taiwan, warning against its territorial ventures in the South China Sea, and warning of a tough new initiative to wring a better deal on trade issues out of the Asian giant.Many foreign policy experts agree that Washington needs to adopt a more robust posture toward China and accuse the Obama administration of not doing enough to protect US interests in the region.But few would endorse Trump\\'s chosen strategy of sending volleys toward Beijing on Twitter.China\\'s President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, in unusually frank terms for a Chinese leader, delivered a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos that appeared to be an open repudiation of much of Trump\\'s emerging China policy.He denied that Beijing was guilty of devaluing its currency as charged by the President-elect and warned that a trade war would benefit no one.\"There\\'s no point in blaming economic globalization for the world\\'s problems,\" Xi told the world\\'s economic elite at the Swiss ski resort.Xi also warned that the world must remain committed to free trade and said protectionism was akin to locking \"oneself in a dark room,\" apparently taking aim at Trump\\'s threats to impose tariffs on Chinese goods because of his belief Beijing has ripped off America in their economic relationship.Xi also delivered a veiled warning to Trump not to tear up the global pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions last year, following the President-elect\\'s warnings to do just that once he comes into office.Xi suggested that China intends to move quickly to identify economic opportunities from what it clearly believes is a pullback by the new Trump administration on leadership on global trade.Russia US-Russia relations haven\\'t been this bad since the end of the Cold War.The Obama administration and the Kremlin have been estranged over President Vladimir Putin\\'s apparent attempts to undermine US power and Western-style liberalism, over the incursion into Ukraine and an alleged Russian espionage operation to help throw last year\\'s election to Trump.Now Putin, who is hoping Trump\\'s vow to improve relations will mean he is open to Moscow\\'s foreign policy priorities, is paying Trump back for his warm comments toward the Russian leader throughout his campaign and transition.\"I don\\'t know what he will be doing on the international stage. So I have no foundation to criticize him nor to defend him,\" Putin said on Tuesday.The Russian leader dismissed accusations that Moscow\\'s intelligence agencies had amassed incriminating financial and personal information against Trump in order to compromise the new US president.\"These things that have been alleged are clearly false information,\" Putin said.But the solicitous comments that fly back and forth frequently between Trump and Moscow are causing consternation among foreign policy experts and sparking alarm about the President-elect\\'s motives in Europe.Some are noting that Moscow has far more to gain than the US through a possible rapprochement, including its hopes for a lifting of US sanctions, de-facto recognition of its annexation of Crimea, and a more skeptical US view of NATO.Comments by Trump in an interview with the Times of London and the German newspaper Bild over the weekend questioning the utility of the Western alliance, predicting more departures from the EU, and recreating some kind of great power deal-making relationship on issues like fighting terrorism and bargaining nuclear weapons, caused alarm throughout Europe.\"What Mr. Trump articulated in this series of interviews ... that is exactly the goals and aspirations of the Kremlin: to erode NATO \\'s credibility, to erode the European Union and to conquer and divide, to get to a great power relationship on arms control where it is back to the future and two great powers will solve everything,\" said Heather Conley, director of the European affairs program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\"Those are Russian interests,\" she added.GermanyIt takes a lot to shock German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And, publicly at least, she was unruffled when Trump implied to the European journalists that he trusted Putin just as much as he did , at least for now. But the idea that an American President could be as warm to a Russian leader accused of interfering in the US election than a German chancellor shocked many observers.\"Chancellor Merkel is the leader of Germany, which has been a very close American ally for decades,\" former US Ambassador to Ukraine Stephen Pifer told CNN on Tuesday.\"To put them on the same plane is a pretty remarkable statement that has caused a lot of concern not just in Washington, but I think among American allies in Europe about what the Trump presidency is going to mean for how the United States engages with Europe and deals with Russia.\"NATO and the European UnionTrump\\'s statements in the weekend interview triggered disbelief in Europe.NATO and the European Union are considered centerpieces of a largely successful political effort to purge Europe of the bloodletting that stained its history for hundreds of years. Yet Trump seems to have little use for either institution, which are both already facing pressure from the populist economic forces that the President-elect harnessed in the US election as well as Moscow\\'s most belligerent behavior since the end of the Cold War. Trump was asked whether a strong Europe or stronger nation-states was most important to the US. \"Personally, I don\\'t think it matters much for the United States. I never thought it mattered,\" he said. \"Look, the EU was formed, partially, to beat the United States on trade, OK? So, I don\\'t really care whether it\\'s separate or together, to me it doesn\\'t matter.\"Trump\\'s comments represented a departure from decades of US foreign policy. Despite tensions and differences with the bloc, Washington\\'s preference has always been for a strong, united EU because it represents a fellow anchor of the world\\'s liberal, open, trading and political system.Trump\\'s attitude toward NATO caused similar disquiet among Atlanticists.The 28-nation Western alliance was set up in the late 1940s to guard against a rising Soviet threat. Many of its members, particularly in former Warsaw Pact countries now feel a similar threat from Moscow\\'s territorial maneuverings.The President-elect, however, considers NATO \"obsolete\" largely because he believes it is not doing enough to deal with terrorism, despite the fact that the only time that NATO\\'s Article 5 mutual defense provision has ever been invoked was after a terrorist attack — on September 11, 2001.Since then, thousands of NATO troops have served in Afghanistan, fighting to stop the war-ravaged country from again becoming a haven for extremist groups like al Qaeda.\"We were attacked on 9/11, and not any of these countries and they sent their young men and women to serve in Afghanistan, and over 1,000 were killed in Afghanistan,\" Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain said on CNN\\'s \"New Day\" on Tuesday. \"Not because they were attacked but because we were attacked.\"Former Sen. and Middle East peace negotiator George Mitchell, meanwhile, argued that Trump risked subverting one of America\\'s great achievements: the building of a new transatlantic order from the rubble of two world wars in which 68 million people died.\"I believe historians will judge that to be one of America\\'s finest hours,\" said Mitchell on CNN Tuesday.'],\n",
       " ['London (CNN)US Secretary of State John Kerry has criticized President-elect Donald Trump for a newspaper interview in which he branded NATO \"obsolete\" and said Germany had pursued a \"catastrophic\" policy on refugees.Kerry told CNN\\'s Christiane Amanpour it was \"inappropriate\" for Trump to \"be stepping in to the politics of other countries in a quite direct manner.\"Trump\\'s interview in the Times of London and the German publication Bild had rattled allies. The German foreign minister said it had caused \"astonishment and agitation\" within NATO.As well as repeating his criticism of NATO, Trump said the German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made a \"catastrophic\" mistake in accepting one million refugees. He also said sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea could be eased in return for a deal to reduce nuclear weapons, and suggested his son-in-law Jared Kushner could lead a Middle East peace effort.In his CNN interview, Kerry defended Merkel as \"one of the strongest leaders in Europe\" and \"most important players with respect to where we are heading.\"Trump would have to deal with the consequences of his remarks after his inauguration later this week, Kerry said. \"He\\'ll have to speak to that -- as of Friday, he\\'s responsible for that relationship,\" Kerry told CNN.Merkel shrugged off the criticism on Monday. \"We have known what his position is for some time, and my position is also known,\" she told reporters in Berlin.But her foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, suggested NATO was rattled by Trump\\'s comments. Steinmeier said he had spoken with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, \"who is concerned that President-elect Trump regards NATO as obsolete.\"He noted Trump\\'s position was \"in contradiction\" to that of Gen. James Mattis, Trump\\'s nominee for defense secretary.Trump used the interview to suggest a new deal with Russia, saying sanctions imposed on Russia after it seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 could be eased in return for a nuclear weapons deal.He also heaped praise on Kushner, saying he could play a peacemaker role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\"Do you know what? Jared is such a good guy; he will conclude an Israel agreement that no one else can do. You know, he is a natural talent, he is amazing, he is a natural talent,\" Trump said, according to Bild.'],\n",

Power, who has sparred publicly with her Russian counterpart on the UN Security Council over Moscow\\'s annexation of Crimea, interference in Ukraine and military action in Syria on behalf of the Assad regime, said that while she hopes the next administration can expand US-Russian cooperation, it shouldn\\'t be attempted \"from the standpoint of weakness,\" or under what she called \"terms of appeasement.\"\"To have historical amnesia when the stakes are this high, for us, for our shared security, for prosperity, for trade, for everything, would be a grave mistake,\" she said. Power also defended the United Nations against threats by Trump and some congressional Republicans to defund the world body in response to a recent Security Council vote condemning Israeli settlements.\"Very few of the threats that we face in the 21st Century are ones that we can deal with on our own,\" said Power. \"And when we step away from leading on the global stage, the people who take our place are not people we want leading the world.\"Power and her Obama administration colleagues have been careful not to directly criticize Trump since Election Day. But as her time in office draws to a close, there are signs she may be more vocal in her post-government career.Over the weekend, Power opened a new Twitter account, and tweeted: \"We are not going gently into the night.\"\"I think it speaks for itself,\" Power said of the tweet, suggesting she and her colleagues in the Obama administration will stand up for the policies they\\'ve put in place. \"We are not going to stand on the sidelines, I think, when we see things that are making the world safer under challenge\" said Power. \"But by the same token, we will be the first to cheer if we see things that are making the world better.\"'],\n",
       " [' (CNN)With less than a month left in office, Secretary of State John Kerry issued a stern rebuke Wednesday over Israeli settlements and warned that the two-state solution to the enduring conflict with Palestinians is at risk.Kerry defended the United States\\' decision last week to abstain from a vote on -- and not veto -- a UN resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as one aimed at \"preserving the two-state solution,\" which he called \"the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\"\"I am also here to share my conviction that there is still a way forward if the responsible parties are willing to act,\" Kerry said, opening his speech.But he underscored his optimism with a warning: \"Despite our best efforts over the years, the two-state solution is now in serious jeopardy.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired back, deriding Kerry\\'s speech as \"skewed against Israel\" in a statement Wednesday.\"For over an hour, Kerry obsessively dealt with settlements and barely touched upon the root of the conflict -- Palestinian opposition to a Jewish state in any boundaries,\" Netanyahu said.Netanyahu also signaled his support for the incoming Donald Trump administration, saying, \"Israel looks forward to working with Trump to mitigate the damage this resolution has done and ultimately to repeal it. We hope the outgoing Obama administration will prevent any more damage.\"The back-and-forth was a remarkable moment in US-Israeli relations. Kerry and Netanyahu were unusually candid in articulating the perceived shortcomings of the other side. The dueling speeches essentially offered both countries the opportunity to unleash nearly eight years of tension that has built up under the Obama administration. And it played out just over three weeks before Trump takes office with a pledge to work more closely with Netanyahu.\\'That\\'s how we work\\'Kerry called on both Israelis and Palestinians to take steps showing the seriousness of their commitment to a two-state solution, such as complying with the terms of the Oslo Accords. He put forward six principles he argued should guide future negotiations, including secure borders for both an Israeli and Palestinian state, a \"fair and realistic\" solution to the question of Palestinian refugees and establishing Jerusalem as an \"internationally recognized capital of the two states.\"Kerry also ruled out the possibility the US would join efforts to dictate peace terms at the UN Security Council or that the US would recognize a Palestinian state without a negotiated agreement.\"The incoming administration has signaled that they may take a different path, and even suggested breaking from long-standing US policies on settlements, Jerusalem -- and possibly the two-state solution,\" Kerry said. \"That is for them to decide. That\\'s how we work.\"Kerry acknowledged as much, noting Trump has signaled a break with long-standing US policies toward the conflict.Trump, in his latest breach of presidential transition protocol, made clear on Twitter Wednesday morning ahead of Kerry\\'s speech that change was on the way.\"We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)!\" Trump tweeted. \"Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!\"Asked about the speech later Wednesday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump said it \"speaks for itself.\"Congress is taking steps to back Trump\\'s approach. House Republicans are looking to bring up a non-binding House resolution condemning a recent vote at United Nations that has caused intense blowback from Israel.Kerry on Wednesday offered the US\\'s most direct rejection of Israeli claims that the US worked behind the scenes to guide the UN resolution to passage and criticized those claims as an attempt to \"distract attention from what the substance of this vote really was all about.\"\"The United States did not draft or originate this resolution, nor did we put it forward,\" he said, adding that the US simply made it clear to the resolution\\'s sponsors that \"if the text was more balanced, it was possible we wouldn\\'t block it.\"Kerry bemoans conflict\\'s status quoKerry lamented the status quo in Israel and the Palestinian territories, drawing on personal experiences as he criticized Israeli and Palestinian actions he said hurt chances for a two-state solution.He pointed to the conflict\\'s impact on children in both Israel and the Palestinian territories -- from Israeli children facing rocket fire and must rush to shelter at the sounding of a siren, to destruction in the Gaza Strip, where he said he remembered seeing Palestinian children playing in the rubble.Kerry argued that current Israeli settlement policy in the region was leading toward a future of \"one state and perpetual occupation\" and slammed the arguments of right-wing Israeli officials who argue settlements are aimed at bolstering Israel\\'s security. He also reserved special criticism for Netanyahu, whose governing coalition Kerry called \"the most right-wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements.\"\"They\\'re leading towards one state,\" he said.And the secretary of state also pointed to the recent rapid growth of settlements east of the 1967 borders, which have long been seen as the basis for the territory of a future Palestinian state alongside Israel.He noted that the Israeli settler population in the West Bank has grown by 270,000 since the Oslo Accords of the 1990s.But while he argued that settlements furthered the likelihood of a one-state solution that would jeopardize Israel\\'s status as both a Jewish and democratic state, Kerry stressed that settlements are not \"the whole or even primary cause of this conflict.\"Kerry also acknowledged that Palestinian leaders, including the moderate Fatah faction that rules the West Bank, continue to glorify Palestinian terrorists who carry out attacks against Israeli civilians.Defending the Obama administrationThe outgoing secretary of state\\'s speech at the State Department comes amid heightened tensions between the US and Israeli administrations over the UN resolution vote.And Kerry sought to push back against arguments that the abstention amounted to a US betrayal of Israel.He defended the administration\\'s commitment to Israel, arguing that \"no American administration has done more for Israel\\'s security than Barack Obama\\'s\" and noting that Netanyahu has acknowledged as much as it comes to US security cooperation and military aid.RELATED: John Kerry\\'s mission to save diplomacyKerry had planned to give the speech last Thursday, when the vote was originally planned. Those plans got scrapped after the proposal\\'s original sponsor, Egypt, forced a delay for a day.Regarding the timing of Kerry\\'s speech, two White House sources told CNN the Obama administration wanted to make it clear where it stands on the Israeli-Palestinian issue as a matter of principle and as a matter of history.Netanyahu respondsNetanyahu offered a quick reply to Trump\\'s tweet earlier Wednesday morning vowing stronger US backing for the Jewish state, thanking Trump on Twitter for his \"warm friendship\" and \"clear-cut support.\"And after Kerry spoke, Netanyahu derided the speech as \"skewed against Israel,\" arguing that Israel doesn\\'t need \"to be lectured by foreign leaders.\" Netanyahu insisted Palestinian leaders were the \"root of the problem,\" not Israel\\'s government.\"In these days of the Hanukah holiday, the light must overcome the darkness, and Israel\\'s light must overcome all challenges with the Jewish Menorah lights I would like to bring light in the world,\" he added.Deputy speaker of the Knesset Ahmad Tibi, one of the most influential Arab members of Israel\\'s parliament, slammed Netanyahu for deriding Kerry\\'s speech, pointing to opposition among Democrats in the US to Israel\\'s settlement policy.\"Let\\'s face the facts: Israel is upset because this American action advances freedom and equal rights for Palestinians,\" Tibi said.Netanyahu\\'s government has said in recent days Israel will provide detailed, sensitive information to the incoming Trump administration to bolster their claims that the US played a covert role in pushing passage of the UN Security Council resolution on Israel.

And my first priority has to be what\\'s the right thing to do for America,\" he said.\"Based on hours of meetings ... where we went through every option in painful detail ... short of putting large numbers of US troops on the ground, uninvited, without any international law mandate, without sufficient support from Congress,\" it would have been impossible.\"We couldn\\'t do it on the cheap,\" he said.Obama\\'s condemnation comes as an agreement allowing for the evacuation of the thousands of civilians left in the besieged city appeared to fall apart Friday.Forces loyal to the Assad regime have shelled eastern Aleppo and after years of fighting, his troops have managed to break through rebel defensive lines, seizing some of the last few Syrian rebel holdouts in recent days.The operation to evacuate thousands of refugees was halted, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Various reports cited violations of the cessation of hostilities as reason for the interruption. Thousands of civilians, wounded residents, and some rebels had already been evacuated under the agreement, with many of the refugees going to rebel-held Idlib province or the Syrian-Turkish border.

       " [' (CNN)President Barack Obama and his first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, entered the White House in 2009 with visions of a \"Russian reset.\" But Obama will leave office next month in the midst of a shadowy Cold War-era fever dream, as Washington and Moscow are, once again, beset by accusations of diplomatic chicanery and outright espionage.In dropping a new round of targeted sanctions on Russian diplomats and assets in the US, Obama on Thursday struck back at what the intelligence community has portrayed as an unprecedented -- and successful -- attempt by the Kremlin to meddle in the American democratic process. But even as President Vladimir Putin trolls the White House, saying he will turn the other cheek and sit tight awaiting what figures to be a more friendly administration on the horizon, questions outpace answers. So what comes next and who holds the advantage? Here\\'s what we know, what the players are saying -- and how the chess match is unfolding.What did the US do on Thursday and why?After weeks of ramped-up accusations about Russian hacking and promises of retaliation, the White House announced plans to expel 35 Russian diplomats -- giving them and their families 72 hours to leave the country -- and shuttering a pair of Russian compounds in New York and Maryland used by officials, in theory, for recreational purposes.     The new sanctions follow months of insinuations, leaks and, more recently, open accusations that Moscow set out on a coordinated campaign to hack the private communications of American political actors, making public information that would both undermine voters\\' confidence in the November elections and, according to some, boost Trump\\'s campaign.In a \"joint analysis report\" by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, released with the sanctions notice on Thursday a summary titled \"Russian Malicious Cyber Activity\" and provided a detailed flowchart seeking to illustrate the complex nature of the Russian hacking effort. How did Putin respond to the new sanctions?The Russian President\\'s decision to postpone any retaliation for Washington\\'s sanctions, despite Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recommending the tit-for-tat expulsion of US diplomats, surprised some Kremlin-watchers.In retrospect, Moscow\\'s tactics appeared orchestrated: first threatening to match the explosions announced by the Obama administration the previous day, then, in seeking to appear magnanimous -- even extending an invitation to the children of American diplomats in Washington to a Christmas party at the Kremlin -- backing off. At the same time, Putin laid the onus of action on incoming President Donald Trump.\"It\\'s a smart play,\" said James Nixie, head of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the London-based think-tank Chatham House. He said that while \"Russia feels humiliated -- it has been exposed and it has been punished,\" Putin can afford to wait a few weeks to hit back. \"He\\'s thought about it, considered acting now, but in fact is just being patient,\" Nixie said.Putin\\'s decision will force Trump to show his hand -- and fast.  \"If Trump doesn\\'t play ball, then we\\'ll be back to the old-style adversarial relations,\" Nixie said. Putin is waiting to see \"is Trump on our side, or is he not? At this point, we don\\'t know, either.\"On Friday afternoon, the President-elect offered some blunt instruction.\"Great move on delay (by V. Putin),\" he tweeted. \"I always knew he was very smart!\"Is this the start of a new Cold War?While there are echoes of the Cold War in the matching expulsion threats, Nixie argued that Russia\\'s actions are predominantly about its future, not its past: Moscow \"wants a new set of rules\" to govern the way the world is run -- who wields the power, who controls what, and who listens to whom.Putin\\'s move can also be read as an \"enormous insult\" to the Obama administration, said Jill Dougherty, a Russia analyst and former Moscow bureau chief for CNN.\"It\\'s an amazing move and it\\'s classic Putin,\" she said. \"He\\'s a master of doing things that are unexpected, and this is truly unexpected.\"How strong is the US case against Russia?That depends on whom you ask.  Trump has for months routinely questioned government assertions that state-sponsored Russian hackers were behind the breaches at the Democratic National Committee and inside Clinton\\'s campaign. He has suggested the Chinese could be to blame, or even \"somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\"But the US government has been laser-focused on Moscow for months. In October, officials publicly announced they were \"confident\" Russia had targeted the Democratic Party and aligned organizations. Obama this summer allowed, but stopped short of asserting in an interview that Putin had intended to aid Trump.  How the unflattering communications put on display by the hacks affected the election is nearly impossible to quantify, but the slow drip seemed calculated to sow discord and doubt, especially among Democrats during and after a tense primary contest.Trump now says he\\'ll meet with the intelligence community to hear their case. Why did the White House act now?The ultimate decision followed a CIA announcement this month, made in private to a group of top US senators, that the hacks were carried out with the express purpose of delivering the White House to Trump.Their evidence -- which, again, has not been made public except through leaks to the press -- includes findings that Russian hackers breached, but did not make public information stolen from the accounts of Republicans, including House members and GOP non-profits, according to a former senior law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the hack investigation told CNN.The Republican National Committee has denied reports that it was compromised or targeted, and earlier this month, Trump\\'s incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, questioned the intelligence community\\'s motives.\"If they are so certain it happened, why won\\'t they go on the record and say it?\" Spicer told CNN. \"I don\\'t understand it. It doesn\\'t make any sense.\"What is Obama\\'s angle here?The Russians tend to get the credit -- and criticism -- for being crafty or acting covertly to advance a range of interests. On its face, the new round of sanctions are a simple act of retaliation -- less a deft or devious hand than a symbolic swat -- for the Kremlin\\'s alleged role in the election season hacks.   But whether it was intended or not, the Obama administration\\'s decision to act now, less than a month before clearing out ahead of Trump\\'s inaugural, will have a series of knock-on effects that should create difficulties and set a series of political traps for the new administration.Trump has made no secret of his hopes to establish better relations with Putin and his autocratic regime. He played down news of the sanctions on Thursday, saying it was \"time for the country to move on to bigger and better things.\" A day earlier, the President-elect seemed to throw up his hands entirely, pleading ignorance -- and skepticism -- of all things tech.\"The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on,\" he said. \"And we have speed -- we have a lot of other things, but I\\'m not sure we have the kind the security we need.\" Trump will need a more comprehensive argument, and understanding, if he is going to successfully navigate a Congress almost uniformly in favor of maintaining or, in the case of hawks like Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain, pursuing further avenues of redress.If Obama, his legislative legacy under threat from all corners, can effectively tie up the new administration and members of its own party -- to say nothing of Democrats who will gladly align themselves with more mainstream Republicans -- then he stands a better chance of at least complicating Trump\\'s efforts to undo the work of the past eight years.What is Trump\\'s play now? Trump, who has repeatedly said he just wants everyone to move on, can undo the Thursday sanctions with relative ease after he takes office on January 20. But a unilateral decision to reverse course could expose divisions in a GOP caucus that, for all its post-election talk of unity, remains fundamentally divided on key issues like spending and what to do after it repeals Obamacare.The confluence of Obama\\'s action and Putin\\'s demurral will test Trump right from the jump, as moving for steadier relations with Moscow will now come at a heightened domestic cost. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Russia critic, will likely seek to influence Trump, further stressing their already fragile relationship and challenging incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus, who has emerged as a trusted middleman between his idiosyncratic boss and the established GOP order.While the GOP establishment has stayed critical of Russia, Trump sees it differently. He is also threatened by his unique handicap -- an apparent inability to, at least publicly, conceive of the hacking story as anything more or less than a backdoor assault on the legitimacy of his victory on Election Day.  \"If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act?\" he asked in a tweet last week, before the sanctions had been finalized. \"Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\"The claim was demonstrably false -- the grousing had begun well before November 8 -- but made clear how Trump perceives the question. In his Thursday statement, the President-elect was more reserved and revealed he would, \"in the interest of our country and its great people,\" take a meeting with \"leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.\" How Trump responds to those facts, and whether he accepts them at all, will go a long way in articulating the paths ahead. But until those options are clear, his likeliest route is anyone\\'s guess.'],\n",
       " ['Washington (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Tuesday evening to deride the US intelligence agencies due to brief him on alleged Russian hacking of American political groups.It was his latest attack on a key body he will rely on as commander in chief and again put him at odds with the agencies\\' unanimous conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic Party groups and individuals to interfere in the US presidential election.Trump suggested that intelligence officials postponed an \" \\'intelligence\\' briefing on so-called \\'Russian hacking\\' \" that they were set to deliver to him this week because they might need more time \"to build a case.\" He called the alleged delay \"very strange.\"Trump tweeted Wednesday, \"Julian Assange said \\'a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta\\' - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!\"Trump said last week that he would receive an intelligence briefing on the Russian breaches this week and suggested it would come early on, telling reporters on New Year\\'s Eve that they would know more about the subject \"Tuesday or Wednesday.\"But US intelligence officials disputed Trump\\'s tweet alleging a delay.Top US intelligence officials have been scheduled to brief Trump on the full report on Russian hacking President Barack Obama ordered once it was completed, but the meeting was not set to take place until later in the week, according to US officials.The meeting was never scheduled for Tuesday, as even Obama has yet to receive the full-fledged briefing on the Russian hacking, one US official said.And a US intelligence official told CNN that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was never scheduled to be in New York City, where Trump is, on Tuesday -- and was perplexed about the \"delay\" Trump claimed was taking place.Trump on Tuesday did receive a classified intelligence briefing -- the Presidential Daily Briefing -- which Trump has elected to receive only sporadically. But it did not dive deeply into the Russian hacking.WikiLeaks\\' Assange: Russia didn\\'t give us emailsUS officials briefed on the matter said Clapper, National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers, FBI Director James Comey and CIA Director John Brennan are scheduled to attend the meeting with Trump providing him details on the Russian hacking.While Obama met with the heads of US intelligence agencies in his first weeks as president-elect, Trump has yet to do so eight weeks after he was elected, which US officials said was due to Trump\\'s scheduling conflicts.Instead, the President-elect has repeatedly questioned their assessment of Russian cyber activity.Before the election, when 17 US intelligence agencies issued a public statement concluding that Russia orchestrated the hack of the Democratic National Committee, Trump immediately cast doubt on those conclusions, arguing it was impossible to distinguish between a Russian government operative and \"somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\"After Obama then slapped a series of sanctions on Russia, Trump issued a statement calling for the country to \"move on to bigger and better things\" and then tweeted praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin for not retaliating against the sanctions.Trump continued his skepticism on New Year\\'s Eve, telling reporters once again that it \"could be somebody else.\"\"I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove,\" he said.He added that he also knows \"things that other people don\\'t know, so they can\\'t be sure of the situation.\"On Tuesday, Russia again denied intervening in the US election campaign. Reacting to a US intelligence official who told CNN the administration traced the hack to specific keyboards, which featured Cyrillic characters, Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov said: \"I don\\'t understand what this means exactly but Cyrillic characters can be used everywhere.\" \"Once again I reject any possibility that official Russia can be involved in any way,\" he added. In December, Peskov said it was \"indecent\" of the US to \"groundlessly\" accuse Russia of intervention in the US election campaign. '],\n",
       " ['Washington (CNN)The speaker of the House, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman and the ranking Democrat on the committee said Thursday that they\\'ve seen no evidence of President Donald Trump\\'s accusation that he was wiretapped last year by his predecessor. \"We have not seen any evidence that there was a wiretap or a (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) court order against Trump Tower or somebody in Trump Tower,\" Speaker Paul Ryan said in an interview Thursday on CNN\\'s \"The Situation Room\" with Wolf Blitzer.Ryan said, however, that he still trusted Trump, and that the apparently false claims the President aired on Twitter would not damage the White House\\'s credibility.\"I think the President\\'s going to be marked and judged by his record,\" Ryan said. Senate Intelligence Committee chair Richard Burr and ranking member Mark Warner issued a statement earlier Thursday, saying \"based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016.\"The statement from the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee marks the clearest and strongest refutation of Trump\\'s allegations since the President first made them two weeks ago. The senators statement also addresses Trump\\'s more recent statement that he was not merely speaking about wiretapping specifically.  RELATED: Actually, Mr. President, wiretapping doesn\\'t cover a lot of thingsThe White House on Thursday said the statement did not shake their confidence in the accusation. Press secretary Sean Spicer, asked to respond to the accusation, read an extensive litany of news reports from the podium that showed intelligence agencies\\' interest in Trump\\'s activities, but none that actually corroborated Trump\\'s claim.\"He stands by it,\" Spicer said, characterizing the Intelligence Committee\\'s statement as not final. \"They have yet to go through the information.\"Spicer engaged in a lengthy exchange with CNN\\'s Jim Acosta over whether the President stands by his allegation that he was wiretapped specifically and not under surveillance in general.\"We talked about this several days ago,\" Spicer said. \"The bottom line is that the investigation by the House and Senate has not been provided all the information.\" The White House later on Thursday got pushback from GCHQ, the NSA\\'s counterpart in the United Kingdom, over some of Spicer\\'s remarks. At his briefing, Spicer read a statement from Fox News\\' Judge Andrew Napolitano, who had cited sources claiming Obama \"used GCHQ\" to provide transcripts of Trump\\'s conversations.A GCHQ spokesman responded, saying: \"Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct \\'wire tapping\\' against the then President-elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.\"The leaders of the House Intelligence Committee have said they have yet to see any evidence of wiretapping, but have yet to flatly rule out all surveillance. House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes admitted that he doesn\\'t believe Obama ordered a physical wiretap or other surveillance activities of Trump Tower, but added, \"we want to make sure that no surveillance activities were used for political purposes.\"Nunes had said Wednesday that it was possible that Trump aides were surveilled via \"incidental\" collection. But when asked Thursday if lawmakers have evidence to suggest that anyone in the Trump orbit\\'s communications had been collected incidentally, Nunes pointed only to the leak of fired national security adviser Michael Flynn\\'s communications with a Russian ambassador.\"Other than Gen. Flynn, we don\\'t,\" he said.Ranking Democrat of the House committee Adam Schiff told CNN that he expects FBI Director James Comey to also say that he\\'s seen no evidence of Trump\\'s claim when the director testifies before his committee Monday.\"Because there\\'s no evidence of this at all,\" Schiff told CNN. \"But again you can see the President trying to say, \\'Well I didn\\'t mean what I said or what I said could mean various different things\\' — he was very specific in what he said. So we\\'ll ask the director to address that very specific allegation.\"Their statement came hours after Ryan said at a news conference that \"no such wiretap existed,\" citing intelligence reports to House leaders. \"The intelligence committees, in their continuing, widening, ongoing investigations of all things Russia, got to the bottom -- at least so far with respect to our intelligence community -- that no such wiretap existed,\" Ryan said in response to a question from CNN.The comments from leaders in Congress follows Trump and the White House retreating from the President\\'s stunning accusation in a tweet two weeks ago. \"When I say wiretapping, those words were in quotes. That really covers -- because wiretapping is pretty old-fashioned stuff -- but that really covers surveillance and many other things. And nobody ever talks about the fact that it was in quotes, but that\\'s a very important thing,\" Trump told Fox News Wednesday. RELATED: For Paul Ryan, it\\'s now -- or maybe never'],\n",
       " ['Washington (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump claims to have inside information on Russia\\'s meddling in the United States\\' election -- and promises to reveal it \"Tuesday or Wednesday.\" At a New Year\\'s Eve party at his Mar-A-Lago estate, a tuxedoed Trump maintained that another culprit aside from Russia could have been behind the election intrusion.\"It could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don\\'t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation,\" he said.Liberal groups want delay of Sessions hearingAsked to describe what undisclosed information he knew, Trump said: \"You\\'ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.\"The latest developments in Trump\\'s denial of the American intelligence community\\'s assessment -- widely accepted by both Democrats and Republicans -- that Russia hacked Democratic operatives\\' emails in a bid to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton will be among the leading political stories this week, as Trump\\'s transition efforts resume and a new Congress is sworn in. Here are five other political stories to watch this week: Trump vs. the GOP on RussiaThe Russia hacks aren\\'t just driving a wedge between Trump and the Obama administration. Some Republicans on Capitol Hill are backing Obama\\'s moves last week to sanction Russia, and are calling for legislation to add even more sanctions on top of those announced by the White House. The Senate Armed Services Committee, chaired by Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, will hold a hearing on cyberthreats and the election-related hacking Thursday. The issue could set the tone for relations between Trump and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate. New Congress kicks offThe newly elected Congress will begin its work Tuesday at noon with a vote to officially re-elect Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan as House speaker. Several new faces will appear in Congress, including Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and former Republican Florida governor and Senate candidate Charlie Crist, who is set to become a Democratic congressman. So will Florida\\'s Brian Mast, a Republican and Army veteran who lost both of his legs in Afghanistan. An old face, meanwhile, will appear in the Senate. Vice President Joe Biden will be back in the body where he spent more than three decades to swear in new senators, including California\\'s Kamala Harris and Nevada\\'s Catherine Cortez Masto, who replaces retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. Hill Republicans eye busy first 100 days of 2017The Senate will quickly move toward confirmation battles over Trump\\'s nominees -- with Democrats complaining that nominees aren\\'t submitting materials they\\'ve requested, including their financial information and shouldn\\'t get hearings and votes until those are provided. House Republicans, meanwhile, will condemn the Obama administration\\'s handling of a United Nations vote on Israeli settlements on the West Bank. And House Democrats are opposing a GOP-backed rule change that would impose new fines for members who break rules of decorum. It\\'s an effort to stop Democrats from using platforms such as Periscope and Meerkat to live-stream sit-ins on the House floor, as they did last year. Obamacare strategy sessionPresident Barack Obama will make an unusual trip for a lame-duck president -- visiting Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning to meet with congressional Democrats and discuss how to fight Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to push the repeal of Obama\\'s signature domestic achievement in the first week of the new Congress. Democrats, meanwhile, face a defining moment in the early stages of the Trump era: If party members pledge not to help the GOP pass any replacement, it would place enormous pressure on Trump and congressional Republicans to come up with a way to keep 20 million Americans insured -- and get Congress to approve such a program. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will hold a conference call with House Democrats Monday on Obamacare. What else can Obama get done before leaving office? He\\'s still working toward closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and could make additional pardons. His farewell speech will also be formally announced Monday. Filling out the CabinetAfter a holiday getaway at his Mar-A-Lago estate, Trump has several cabinet positions left to fill. He\\'s expected to soon announce his choices for secretary of Veterans Affairs and Agriculture. Other key roles remain unfilled, as well -- including solicitor general, where top aide Kellyanne Conway\\'s husband George Conway is reportedly a candidate, as well as Director of National Intelligence and deputy secretary of state. Trump to give depositionTrump will attempt to conclude a piece of older business this week with a deposition at Trump Tower this week. The deposition comes as part of Trump\\'s legal battle with the chef Jose Andres. Andres was supposed to launch a restaurant in the new Trump International Hotel in Washington. But after Trump\\'s attacks on Mexicans as he began his presidential campaign in June 2015, Andres withdrew, and Trump sued him for breach of contract.

       " [' (CNN)On Friday at noon, Donald Trump will become the ultimate guarantor of the West\\'s security.Yet, just days away from the White House, the President-elect is sparking transatlantic turbulence by expressing fresh disdain for the two institutions that have been the bedrock of post-World War II peace, stability and prosperity -- NATO and the European Union.It is too early to tell how the Trump administration will shift America\\'s stance toward Europe, since details have been at a premium both during the election campaign and the transition when policy often has been announced 140 characters on Twitter.But European governments worried about Trump\\'s arrival in the White House now have new reasons to be fearful.Fresh comments by Trump in an interview with two European journalists raise the extraordinary scenario of a new American president who seems to question the fundamental purpose of Western security infrastructure -- an unthinkable prospect ever since the defeat of Nazism and throughout the Cold War.The President-elect warned that NATO was \"obsolete,\" criticized German Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s policy of welcoming Middle Eastern refugees as a mistake, and predicted the United Kingdom would not be the last nation to leave the EU.Although he said Europe could still count on US security guarantees and that he felt \"very strongly\" toward the continent, Trump\\'s comments on NATO were a stunning departure for someone who will be President in a few days.\"No one in mainstream political life has ever questioned NATO and US membership in it,\" said Jamie Kirchick, a journalist who specializes in foreign policy and the author of \"The End of Europe: Dictators, Demagogues and the Coming Dark Age,\" to be published in March.While other US presidents and officials have long vented frustration at the failure of all NATO members to meet their funding commitments, \"never have you had someone come out and say NATO is obsolete,\" Kirchick said.Former US ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder expressed the sense of unpredictability in a tweet, warning: \"Trump is more critical of NATO, EU, & Germany -- all close allies -- than he\\'s ever been of Putin & Russia. We\\'re entering an upside down world.\"Trump argued in a press conference last week that it would be an \"asset\" to America if he could forge a good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, defending his openness to dialogue with a leader who many of his own fellow Republicans view as an unrepentant enemy of the United States.Trump\\'s new salvo means Europe\\'s leaders can no longer console themselves with the thought that Trump\\'s contempt for the transatlantic establishment and tolerance for the world view of Russian President Vladimir Putin can be easily dismissed as the fungible rhetoric of a populist campaigner that will disappear once he\\'s confronted with the responsibilities of being President.Trump will be President in daysAs commander-in-chief, Trump will be in a position to emulate -- on an even wider, global, stage with higher stakes -- the disruption and convention-busting style that shook the Washington establishment.That could mean a rocky time is beckoning for US allies as he questions the unchallenged assumptions that have underlined US power in the world for decades.At the very least, Trump\\'s blast toward Europe is causing confusion about the future course of US foreign policy, given that it differs sharply from the strong pro-NATO, anti-Russia line stated by several of his cabinet nominees, including defense secretary designate James Mattis, last week.In a joint interview with the German newspaper Bild and the Times of London, Trump renewed his contention that NATO is outdated because it has failed to fight terrorism, even though the alliance has been fighting to prevent Afghanistan becoming a terror haven again for years since 9/11.RELATED:  Trump rattle NATO with \\'obsolete\\' blastTearing at fragile European divisions, he described the EU as a \"vehicle\" for German control, and praised Britain for voting to leave -- breaking with decades of US foreign policy orthodoxy that sees a strong, unified Europe as vital to global security.The President-elect also said he had equal trust for Merkel, the undisputed first among equals of European leaders and strong supporter of the transatlantic alliance, and Putin, who US intelligence agencies have accused of interfering in the election.And shredding taboos about intervening in the campaign politics of a foreign nation, Trump caused Merkel a political headache in a tough re-election year by saying that though he respected and admired her, the German leader\\'s decision to welcome hundreds of thousands of Middle East refugees was \"catastrophic.\"German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier said Trump\\'s comments caused \"astonishment and agitation\" in Europe. \"I have just had a conversation with the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who is concerned that President-elect Trump regards NATO as obsolete,\" Steinmeier said.Merkel\\'s office was more tempered, pledging to work closely with the new US president.But other European officials rejected Trump\\'s view that the EU was about to fall apart and they took the line that once it takes power soon, the Trump administration will undaerstand the stakes in Europe and adjust policy accordingly.\"For the last 70 years, Europe and the US have always agreed on one thing -- and that is European unity is in the interests of both parties, both the US and Europe,\" Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission, told CNN\\'s Christiane Amanpour.\"We have built from scratch something that is arguably the most successful peace project in human history,\" he added. \"I am sure that sooner or later, everyone in Washington will understand that it is in the strategic interests of the United States to have a successful European Union.\"Trump\\'s rhetoric or is it reality?Trump\\'s comments on NATO are consistent with the campaign rhetoric in which he expressed a transactional role of US global alliances, complaining that Washington\\'s partners are not paying enough for defense.But they are also a startling departure from seven decades of US foreign policy orthodoxy that has used NATO and alliances in Asia to project US power in defense of a liberal, democratic world order.RELATED: Kerry addresses Trump\\'s comments Given all this, Trump\\'s inauguration on Friday will open a period of uncertainty for US allies.\"We have never had a President-elect quite like Mr. Trump,\" former US Middle East peace negotiator Aaron David Miller told CNN on Monday, heralding a new and unpredictable phase dawning in America\\'s relationship with Europe and the world.\"In four days, the ultimate pivot is coming, when, in fact, Mr. Trump will bear responsibility for existing and future US foreign policy.\"NATO nations will have to decide whether they believe Mattis that NATO is a \"vital\" US national security interest or take Trump\\'s comments at face value. Some European governments had been assured by indications earlier in the transition that Trump was backing away from his campaign rhetoric. For instance, in a call with British Prime Minister Theresa May in December, a Downing Street statement said the two leaders agreed \"on the importance of the Alliance.\"But Trump\\'s new comments to the Times and Bild could undermine those hopes.One possible explanation for the President-elect\\'s anti-NATO rhetoric is that, as in many other areas -- for instance China policy, where he has tweaked Beijing over Taiwan -- Trump may be adopting hardline positions that are meant to shock as an opening negotiating position. He\\'s often said he wants to be unpredictable. \"In this case, it is impossible to know, is this an effort on the part of the President-elect to be predictable, to keep allies and adversaries off balance?\" asked Miller.In NATO\\'s case, Trump\\'s aim could be to cajole more members to reach the 2% threshold of GDP target on defense spending required by the alliance.\"One thing\\'s for sure, European nations will have to take more responsibility for their own security,\" said Timmermans. \"I\\'m a strong believer in NATO, it\\'s indispensable. The only one who wants to see NATO fall is Putin.\"But Trump\\'s approach and determination to improve strained US relations with Russia can only add to the deep uncertainty stalking Europe that is already strained by Britain\\'s vote to leave the EU and critical elections looming in Germany and France, in which populist anti-establishment forces are on the rise, along with concerns about the specter of a rambunctious Russia to the east.Though NATO is a 28-member alliance run by a secretary general, it always takes its lead from the US, its most powerful and wealthy member. That makes for unprecedented times, with a US President who appears to doubt the alliance\\'s role.'],\n",
       " ['Austin, Texas (CNN)President Donald Trump\\'s name is on everyone\\'s lips at the 2017 SXSW festival, with performers, experts, advocates and festival-goers weighing in on the 45th president.While it is not overtly partisan, SXSW has historically drawn a generally progressive group of musicians, artists, writers, experts, filmmakers and activists, including Trump\\'s latest entertainer foe — rapper Snoop Dogg, who performed Wednesday night and is set to join artists to advocate for criminal justice reform in a panel Saturday. \"It\\'s hard to take your eye off of the Trump train. I think the conference organizers recognize that this year, more than any other year, the conversation will sway toward the political, despite what they would like to happen,\" Austin Chronicle reporter Chase Hoffberger, who covered SXSW in the past, told CNN.\"(SXSW) is not designed to be a liberal thing, but the messaging is often liberal,\" Hoffberger added. \"Mostly because the industries that are involved are de facto liberal industries.\"  Travel ban rocks SXSWControversy over Trump\\'s new ravel ban rocked the festival even before it began, prompting SXSW organizers to release a statement opposing the executive order, which bans nationals of several Muslim-majority countries from entering the US, as well as temporarily restricting refugee entry.\"With the announcement of President Trump\\'s latest travel ban, SXSW would like to reaffirm its public opposition to these executive orders and provide ongoing support to the artists traveling from foreign countries to our event,\" festival organizers said in a March 7 statement.  The festival then announced a special March 17 showcase featuring \"performances by artists from the diaspora of the nations (affected) by the White House\\'s travel ban.\" \"When Trump tries 2 ban you but you get invited to @sxsw,\" Faarrow, a band made up of two Somali-Canadian sisters, tweeted last week.The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on this story.Controversy over Trump\\'s executive order resurfaced again this week after several foreign artists said they were blocked from entering the country by US Customs and Border Protection officials.The list includes London drummer Yussef Kamaal, members of the UK\\'s United Vibrations, the lead singer of Danish band Rainbrother, Italian band Soviet Soviet and three members of Massive Scar Era, an Egyptian-Canadian band, who spoke out in an interview with Billboard about their interaction with border officials. Several of these artists are Muslim.\"He said that he knows that I\\'ve done everything legally, and that I\\'m not lying, but he\\'s still not going to let me in,\" vocalist Cherine Amr said, referring to a border official. \"He said that people are using the festival to protest but I told him we are not going there to protest.\" \"Our leadsinger Bjarke has been denied access to the US via the usual tunnel. BUT we\\'re still playing @sxsw. Trump isn\\'t gonna win this one,\" Rainbrother tweeted over the weekend.\"We will NOT be playing @sxsw. We got hit by the #ExecutiveOrder 😡 If you wanna show solidarity RT ... #MuslimBan #BLM\" United Vibrations tweeted Monday.In the past, bands have entered the country on a B-1 visitor visa, which which is issued for tourists but restricts them from any paid work in the US. Messages left with CBP were not returned.SXSW does not pay performers, but customs officials released a statement Monday announcing that artists must apply for a P-1 visa instead, which is usually used by athletes entering the US temporarily to perform individually or as a group at an internationally recognized performance.Jonathan Ginsberg, an attorney for SXSW, said the festival is working with US organizations \"in an effort to ensure that both the State Department and CBP continue to treat (performances) as a valid activity in B or visa waiver status.\"\"Commenting on the Customs and Borders comment! Are we an international recognized group?!?!?!??!?!?! NO!!!!!!!\" Egyptian heavy metal band Massive Scar Era tweeted Monday.Some SXSW performers are internationally recognized, but one of the purposes of the festival is to support new, lesser-known artists with little-to-no experience in the national or international spotlight.Questions over the festival\\'s stance on the ban came along with controversy over what appeared to be a deportation clause applicable to international artists in the festival\\'s artist performance agreement.New York punk band Told Slant shared the language on Twitter and threatened to boycott the event, along with other bands.Organizers eliminated the language, which previously stated that the festival could \"notify the appropriate U.S. immigration authorities\" if they \"or their representatives have acted in ways that adversely affect the viability of their official SXSW showcase.\" \"I\\'m happy that sxsw agreed to make changes to their contract so that it no longer threatens deportation as a means of controlling artists,\" Felix of Told Slant tweeted.\"We will remove the option of notifying immigration authorities in situations where a foreign artist might \\'adversely affect the viability of Artist\\'s official showcase,\\'\" organizers said in a statement released on the festival\\'s website. \"Safety is a primary concern for SXSW, and we report any safety issues to local authorities. It is not SXSW\\'s duty or authority to escalate a matter beyond local authorities,\" they continued.Activism is a big themeDiscussions and debates about Trump and his policies echoed this week in lecture halls, meeting rooms, concert venues and street corners, making the President, who was not invited to speak at the festival, an omnipresent force.\"This year, the fact that everyone is talking exclusively about world order and Donald Trump, it stands to reason that that\\'s what the conference will have a bit more of a focus on (that),\" Hoffberger said.While politics have always had a place at SXSW, this year, the national surge in activism has made its way into panel discussions represented in various festival verticals -- technology, film, music and interactives. Panels focused on activism in the age of Trump include the following: \"Civil Discourse in the Age of a Twitterer-In-Chief,\" \"From Meme to Protest: What\\'s Next for Online Activism,\" \"All the Rage: Female Activism and Altruistic Design,\" \"For Games to Evolve They Need to Get Political,\" \"How Elections Change Next Gen Cause Engagement\" and \"Power & Perils of Digital Activism Meet Up.\"Tech experts and advocates participated in various Trump-focused panels, including, \"Tech Under Trump,\" \"Tech Advocates and Trump: Best Strategies So Far,\" \"How Will Trump Steer Car and Transportation Tech?\", \"Tech Activism: More Than a Hashtag,\" \"Trump, China, and Trade Wars: Tech in the Trenches?\" and \"Head Fakes and Pivots: Trump Punk Sillicon Valley.\" In the latter, author Baratunde Thurston addressed how the tech industry failed to predict Trump\\'s win and what lessons could be learned from it.The format of the festival also creates room for political discussions and according to Hoffberger, the overlapping of the various verticals on the schedule this year has created more opportunities for politics-based conversations. \"The festival itself is very kind of do your own thing and put it out there for people to respond to,\" the Austin Chronicle\\'s music editor Raoul Hernandez said. \"It\\'s so big that (organizers) know that they can\\'t control the party. The genie is out of the bottle.\"'],\n",
       " ['Washington (CNN)It\\'s reset time for the United States and Saudi Arabia.Saudi officials are heralding a new era in relations after watching their stock tumble in Washington under the Obama administration. And the Trump White House is signaling a strengthened partnership as it begins to reshape US involvement in the Middle East.The Saudis have begun to view Trump as a like-minded partner -- one who put Iran \"on notice\" early in his presidency and has vowed to take a tougher line on the Saudi nemesis than his predecessor. His team also seems less likely to chide the kingdom on human rights issues, a perennial thorn in the US-Saudi relationship.Trump, meanwhile, is eager to win an increased commitment to fighting ISIS from wealthy Gulf nations, and Saudi Arabia would be the ideal first domino to trigger an increased regional commitment.But the fresh relationship will be tested by each side\\'s willingness to deliver on what the other is looking for -- and could ultimately end in disappointment for both parties.The work to reset relations was on full display this week when Saudi Arabia\\'s deputy crown prince and his delegation met with Trump and his top advisers at the White House Wednesday, just one of a series of high-level meetings between Saudi and US officials in recent days.The Saudis extolled the meeting as a \"historic turning point,\" and said it \"marked a significant shift in relations.\" A senior White House official confirmed the rosy portrait to CNN and called the meeting \"very important.\"Pressed Thursday at the Pentagon about whether his country would be willing to put Saudi troops in Syria to fight ISIS, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman replied: \"We are willing to do anything to eradicate terrorism, without limits.\"And in a coup for the White House, Saudi Arabia, home to Islam\\'s holiest site, expressed support for the Trump administration\\'s travel ban, which has targeted several Muslim-majority countries and triggered anger throughout the Muslim world.\"His Excellency expressed his understanding and support for this vital and urgent precaution measure to protect the United States of America from expected terrorist operations,\" a senior adviser to the prince said in a statement.\"Prince Mohammed considers his Excellency (Donald Trump) as a true friend of Muslims who will serve the Muslim world in an unimaginable manner, opposite to the negative portrait of his Excellency that some have tried to promote, whether through publishing unjust statements that are taken out of their context or by means of unrealistic media commentaries and analyses about his Excellency.\"It remains to be seen how much substance the kingdom will put behind such statements, however.\"When I see statements like this -- which are frankly completely over the top -- even the least skeptical journalist should be asking him or herself, is this a reality?\" said Simon Henderson, director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy\\'s Gulf and Energy Policy Program.Henderson argued it was not -- at least not yet -- and said the statements revealed an \"eagerness to kiss goodbye to the Obama administration and deal with the Trump administration.\"\"Whether there is the difference which they\\'re trying to claim is a bit of an open question,\" he added.David Weinberg, an expert on Saudi Arabia at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, suggested the adulatory Saudi statements were part of a strategy.\"It\\'s hard to tell how much of this afterglow is genuine enthusiasm versus flattery,\" Weinberg said, pointing to the Saudi reference to a \"historic turning point\" and exuberant praise of Trump. \"Clearly there\\'s part of a strategy there to go after this president\\'s personality style.\"The Saudis also pledged billions of dollars in investments in the US, which would help Trump politically with his promise of boosting the US economy and creating new jobs -- and even touted the success of a border fence they built on the country\\'s border with Iraq, an apparent reference to Trump\\'s plans to build a wall on the US-Mexico border.But it will take more than praise and vague promises to strengthen the US-Saudi relationship, and both sides\\' response to pressing concerns the other faces are more likely to drive the relationship.While the Trump administration has talked tough on Iran, it has done little so far to suggest a radical shift in how the US tackles growing Iranian influence in the region, an issue deeply concerning to Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies.Saudi Arabia still fears increased Iranian influence in Yemen, where Riyadh is struggling in its fight against Iranian-backed rebels. The Obama administration blocked an arms sale to Saudi Arabia in December over concerns about the rising civilian death toll in Yemen, and the kingdom is eager to see that arms transfer green-lit.Still, Ali Shihabi, executive director of the Arabia Foundation who advises the Saudi government, said the Saudi leadership and the Trump administration are in \"perfect alignment\" on the Iran nuclear deal and said Trump understands Saudi Arabia\\'s conflict with Iran is an \"existential battle.\"At the same time, Saudi Arabia has been reluctant in to boost its involvement in the anti-ISIS coalition, carrying out a small fraction of airstrikes against the terrorist group in Iraq and Syria, Weinberg noted.Trump has made greater involvement of countries in the region a central tenet of his plan to recalibrate the fight against ISIS, calling on Gulf states to provide funding for the fight and help address the issue of refugees.But Shihabi said Saudi Arabia views Syria as a \"lost cause.\"\"Good generals recognize lost battles,\" he told CNN.Older sources of stress in the US-Saudi relationship might also reemerge should Trump revert to his criticism of Saudi Arabia on the campaign trail. During the 2016 race, he knocked the country for insufficiently compensating the US for its military presence in the region and scolded the Clinton Foundation for accepting money from Saudi Arabia despite its human rights record.While Saudi Arabia is looking to regain \"the warmth of the US security blanket,\" as Henderson put it, the US may be looking for not just closer ties, but better terms.Even after the election, Trump continued to paint the US-Saudi relationship as one-sided and vowed to get a better deal.\"We are not being reimbursed for our protection of many of the countries...including Saudi Arabia,\" Trump told the New York Times in mid-November.\"Without us, Saudi Arabia wouldn\\'t exist for very long,\" he warned.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to more accurately characterize Shihabi\\'s position.

But during an appearance on CNN\\'s Erin Burnett \"Outfront,\" Santorum warned that Trump\\'s insistence on standing by his wiretap allegations poses a problem for the President.\"We\\'re not in an election anymore, and it\\'s not his opponent he\\'s throwing off,\" Santorum said. \"I think it\\'s him that he\\'s throwing off.\"\"In this case, he has no opponent,\" Santorum said. \"And who he\\'s hurting is not a rival, he\\'s hurting himself, because he\\'s now the president and it doesn\\'t matter whether he blames Barack Obama or not.

       " [' (CNN)At a Broadway show about welcoming people during a time of need, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hosted Ivanka Trump as his guest of honor.The first daughter sat in the audience Wednesday night alongside US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.The show, \"Come From Away,\" is a musical about the generosity of a remote Canadian town that welcomed 6,579 airline passengers who ended up stranded in Newfoundland after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. \"This story really shows that even in those darkest moments, we can lean on each other,\" Trudeau told the CBC. \"Being there for each other in times of difficulties is something Newfoundlanders get, and it\\'s certainly something Canadians and Americans get.\"Trudeau also downplayed the notion of tensions between the US and Canada, given the two countries\\' diverging policies on refugees and immigrants. Dozens of people have recently fled to Canada from the US following President Donald Trump\\'s executive orders banning refugees and travelers from certain countries. Though a federal judge Wednesday blocked the administration\\'s second iteration of the ban, fears linger among citizens of those nations.Meanwhile, Canada has touted its acceptance of tens of thousands of refugees.\"We\\'re always going to have differences in approaches on certain issues,\" Trudeau told CNN partner CBC when asked about the countries\\' different policies on refugees and immigrants. \"The fundamental hopes for the future and the responsibilities of keeping people safe and building a better future for our kids is something we can always agree on.\"Before the show, Ivanka Trump and Haley greeted Canadian officials.

       " [' (CNN)Republicans on Capitol Hill Thursday applauded the ramp up in defense spending and cuts to non-military expenditures in President Donald Trump\\'s proposed budget, while Democrats argued he was jeopardizing programs critical to American families.Trump released a $1.1 trillion budget outline that proposes a $54 billion increase in defense spending offset by deep cuts to the State Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as dozens of other federal programs.\"To dramatically increase spending on defense and significantly cut spending on the diplomats and development professionals that work hand in glove with our Defense Department in difficult and dangerous parts of the world like Iraq and Afghanistan is unwise,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, told CNN\\'s Chris Cuomo on \"New Day.\"\"It shows an over reliance on the military and an under appreciation of the power and effectiveness of diplomacy,\" Coons added. Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, ranking member of the committee on Homeland Security, said Trump\\'s budget is a \"conservative fantasy\" that lacks \"rational justification.\"\"Democrats and Republicans agree: this \\'skinny\\' budget is dead on arrival. President Trump\\'s first budget is nothing more than a conservative fantasy to slash government with no rational justification,\" the Mississippi Democrat said. \"His budget highlights his obsession with mass deportations and building a border wall while making clear he is more concerned with keeping campaign promises than keeping the country safe and secure.\"\"Let it be clear -- the billions dedicated to massive deportations and a wall along our southwest border hold little promise of preventing a terrorist attack,\" Thompson added.In addition to proposing cuts to the State Department by 28%, Trump\\'s plan aims to dramatically remake the federal government by slashing EPA funds by 31% and HUD by 13.2%.Coons said these reductions harm American families.\"I\\'m also really concerned about deep cuts to the Department of Agriculture, the department of EPA and programs that help make sure that our water is clean and our air is clear,\" he said. \"Things that protect the health of average American families all over the country.\"Trump\\'s budget also would end funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the National Endowment for the Arts and the United States Institute of Peace, among others.Democratic National Committee deputy chairman Rep. Keith Ellison, who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders during the Democratic presidential primaries last year, argued on Twitter that Hillary Clinton never would have cut the programs Trump\\'s budget targets.\"For @realDonaldTrump it\\'s all about power, control, money - acquired by whatever means. Science, morality, common sense? Not in the picture,\" Ellison tweeted. Sanders called Trump\\'s budget \"morally obscene\" and harmful to many of those who Trump pledged to assist. \"President Trump\\'s budget is morally obscene and bad economic policy. It will cause devastating pain to the very people Trump promised to help during the campaign,\" he said in a statement. \"Trump\\'s priorities are exactly opposite of where we should be heading as a nation.\"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican, also opposed Trump\\'s budget request to eliminate funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.\"The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has been a critical tool in our efforts to help protect and restore Lake Erie, and when the Obama administration proposed cuts to the program, I helped lead the effort to restore full funding,\" he said in a statement. \"I have long championed this program, and I\\'m committed to continuing to do everything I can to protect and preserve Lake Erie, including preserving this critical program and its funding.\" Most Republicans, however, cheered the budget.Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Inhofe, however, said the cuts are in taxpayers\\' best interests.\"We want to deliver the services, we want to make things clean, but we\\'re going to take all this stuff that comes out of the EPA that\\'s brainwashing our kids, that\\'s propaganda, things that aren\\'t true, allegations,\" said Inhofe, who famously once brought a snowball to the Senate floor to argue against evidence that global temperatures are rising.Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyoming, added that government programs that are \"duplicative or not delivering results\" have to be cut. \"Our nation currently faces massive budget and spending challenges requiring the attention of this new administration, and improving the effectiveness of the federal government should be job one,\" Enzi said in a statement. \"It is crucial to allocate taxpayer resources efficiently in order to improve and eliminate government programs that are duplicative or not delivering results.\"\"This will allow policymakers to support important priorities, while also helping to address the nation\\'s mammoth national debt,\" Enzi added.The cuts to various foreign aid programs will allow money to be spent on the needs of Americans, Sen. Mike Lee said.\"While our intentions abroad are oftentimes noble, it is important to remember that we have many pressing needs at home. We should prioritize spending that will address these domestic needs, thus fulfilling our promise to put Americans first again,\" the Utah Republican said. \"The defense of our nation, on the other hand, is one of the few constitutional spending obligations we have, and we should continue to proceed with these budgets carefully and prudently.\"The House Freedom Caucus praised what it said was Trump\\'s commitment to conservatism.\"Currently reviewing @POTUS\\' #budget. We\\'re pleased to see a focus on limiting gov\\'t where appropriate while strengthening our nat\\'l defense,\" the group tweeted.Congress ultimately will have the last say on the budget. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen said Congress will take a close look at the budget given that the body has \"the power of the purse.\"\"While the President may offer proposals, Congress must review both requests to assure the wise investment of taxpayer dollars,\" the New Jersey Republican said. \"I\\'m optimistic that we can strike a balance that will enable us to fund the federal government responsibly and address emergency needs, while ensuring this legislation will clear the Congress.\" '],\n",
       " [' (CNN)Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Thursday that President Donald Trump may have declassified sensitive intelligence about a potential hack of the Central Intelligence Agency. \"It\\'s one thing if the President has a detailed and thoughtful conversation with the intelligence community about what to declassify, what to release to the public,\" Schiff told CNN. \"But if, on the other hand, this was simply the President looking for an opportunity to attack his predecessor, and giving little thought to the consequences of what he might be disclosing, that is a big problem.\"\"This is not something that should be done off-the-cuff by the President of the United States just looking for a cheap shot at his predecessor,\" he said. Trump told Fox News Wednesday, \"I just want people to know: the CIA was hacked and a lot of things taken. That was during the Obama years.\" Trump was apparently referring to WikiLeaks\\' release of documents last week that founder Julian Assange said it obtained through a hack of the CIA. Requests for comment to the White House were not immediately returned Thursday. Schiff noted in an earlier statement that the President has the power to declassify intelligence merely by stating it publicly \"but this should be done as the product of thoughtful consideration and with intense input from any agency affected. For anyone else to do what the President may have done would constitute what he deplores as \\'leaks.\\'\"It\\'s possible that Trump may have declassified intelligence about surveillance of his campaign in a series of tweets two weeks ago -- although House and Senate investigators have said they have found no evidence to back up the President\\'s claims. The California Democrat said that he was still trying to learn from intelligence officials precisely what Trump meant. He also said that Trump may have actually leaked information himself, with the comment, after spending weeks blasting intelligence sources and the press over reports about communications between his aides and Russian officials.\"It concerns me greatly that this President, after criticizing so many others about leaking potentially classified information should be discussing things that may very well be classified in such a cavalier fashion,\" Schiff told CNN.

       " [' (CNN)The preliminary outline for President Donald Trump\\'s 2018 budget could slash some funding for a program that provides meals for older, impoverished Americans. The budget blueprint suggests cutting funds for the Department of Housing and Urban Development by about $6.2 billion, a 13.2% decrease from its 2017 funding level. Here\\'s what Trump wants cutAlmost half of those savings will come by eliminating the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program, which provides money for a variety of community development and anti-poverty programs, including Meals on Wheels. \"The federal government has spent over $150 billion on this block grant since its inception in 1974, but the program is not well-targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results,\" the budget blueprint says. Want to read the blueprint for yourself?In addition to painting the program as ineffective, the blueprint says the 2018 budget seeks to \"devolve community and economic development activities to the state and local level.\"Though the blueprint doesn\\'t contain enough detail to know for certain how local Meals on Wheels programs will be affected, spokeswoman Jenny Bertolette said, \"It is difficult to imagine a scenario in which they will not be significantly and negatively impacted if the President\\'s budget were enacted.\"Programs across the country are already serving 23 million fewer meals than they did in 2005, and waiting lists to join Meals on Wheels are growing, she said. About 3% of the budget for Meals on Wheels\\' national office comes from government grants (84% comes from individual contributions and grants from corporations and foundations), but the national association provides support and representation for a larger network of 5,000 independently operated local groups, Bertolette said. The local agencies provide the actual meals and services, she said. The Older Americans Act, as a function of the US Department of Health and Human Services, which is facing the specter of cuts itself, covers 35% of the costs for the visits, safety checks and meals that the local agencies dole out to 2.4 million senior citizens, Bertolette said. Local agencies rely on Community Development Block Grant funds as well as money from the state-administered Community Services Block Grant to fill in the gaps. \"Each state allocates this funding differently, so it\\'s difficult to summarize the total impact on the nationwide network,\" Bertolette said. \"We know for certain that there are Meals on Wheels programs that would lose vital funding if this proposal went through.\"As an example of how it works, the city government of San Jose, California, applies for federal Community Development Block Grant funds for homeless outreach, resolving \"slum and blight\" and other community development needs. In a statement issued before the release of Trump\\'s budget blueprint, the city said it expected to receive more than $2.5 million in funding for the 2016-2017 fiscal year. It planned to spend $100,650 of that on Meals on Wheels. According to Meals on Wheels, roughly one in six senior citizens in the country struggles with hunger, and the organization served 219.4 million meals in 2015. About 63% of those meals are delivered to homes of the elderly. Those who are more ambulatory are fed at local community and senior centers. In addition to providing food, Meals on Wheels offers much-needed human contact for home-bound senior citizens. One of the ancillary benefits of the in-person delivery is that it has decreased the rate of falls in the home, saving the nation about $34 billion a year in that respect alone, Meals on Wheels says. The national association will have a better idea how its network of programs will be affected when the full budget proposal is released in coming months. ']]"
